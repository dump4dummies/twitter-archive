34,@cybrctzn_428 @pmarca Influencer sponsored content is a big business. Many people buy products because someone on social media made them look appealing in a natural way. Companies then boost that organic looking content. I think we will see more of this in the future and less straight up ads.
35,"@pmarca When campaigning, I talked to so many people in their 20s who don‚Äôt care who is in power. In a way, they see themselves as outside our system and don‚Äôt think our govt impacts their lives. They find both parties unacceptable and wouldn‚Äôt consider voting. Really surprised me."
