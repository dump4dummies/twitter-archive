75,"@RossSchumann @TafarAkinyemi It shows the lack of knowledge on the GOP side by those who claim to be constitutional, they could have changed the law when holding the majority in 2014 especially. It shows how they are as inept as well when it comes to duties."
76,"@RossSchumann @TafarAkinyemi True, but if you live in predominantly pro choice areas and have a predominantly pro choice state body it's a up hill battle"
77,"@RossSchumann @TafarAkinyemi Unfortunately,  states such as mine are a small voice currently. I look at the bigger picture on this. Gavin has already made a statement for women to cone here to get an abortion"

88,"@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn It took my Grandfather  years to get agent orange benefits and other benefits when he served in WWII, KOREA AND VIETNAM.  And don't get me started on the VA home loans"
89,"@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn I did 15years, I seen it all. Our VA System still needs better improvements. We need more VA hospitals and offices"
90,"@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn Very sad, that's how government works."
91,@2020istrash2020 Cute🥰🥰🥰
92,@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn It took six months knowing she only had a year to live to get approved...I was like she is now 89 years old and months to live and it took that long?
93,"@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn It's really the lack of taking a initiative to reach out to many, especially older vets who do not have computer access.  My grandmother found out through someone who was part of hospice when they asked her questions about her military exposure while serving."
94,@SonnieJohnson https://t.co/8Sibh0MDBj
95,@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn As a Veteran myself this is a big problem.
96,@BlackSaidWhat @WhipClyburn You are correct. @BlackSaidWhat ! My Grandmother didn't know she qualified for Korean War benefits until she was 88 years old by the time she got her first check she died a month later.
