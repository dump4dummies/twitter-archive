0,This week I officially filed as a candidate for Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. I’m confident that the voters of the sixth are ready to send a political outsider with a military and business background to congress. Onward to May 24th! https://t.co/fAe93nZLbs
1,"With 1 crisis after another piling up, we haven’t forgotten about the servicemembers’ lives he was quick to throw away &amp; even quicker to forget. Our troops join the military knowing they might be asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. We deserve leaders who understand that. (2/2)"
2,"Joe Biden lied repeatedly throughout his State of the Union speech tonight. But most egregiously of all, he neglected to pay respects to the 13 servicemembers he got killed during his bumbling, incompetent pullout from Afghanistan. He excused himself for that one. (1/2)"
3,The Second Amendment is under attack. This week Remington Arms was forced to pay a $73M settlement to the victims of a crime committed by a person to whom they had never sold a product. I will support additional protections for our beloved All-American companies like Remington. https://t.co/cWz06aME0H
4,I’ll be on @newsmax tomorrow morning. Make sure you tune in to National Report during the 11 o’clock hour.

8,"The Communist Chinese government has become more oppressive at home and more ambitious abroad. China is increasingly aggressive, manipulative and nefarious. The Biden administration has countered China’s advance with pathetic incompetence. It's time we stand up against Red China. https://t.co/JGeRP9SXLj"

12,"Justice Stephen Breyer has announced his retirement. Joe Biden stated he will prioritize race and judicial activism over qualification and originalism in his replacement appointee.  We must oppose this in favor of a textualist, originalist approach to judicial appointees. https://t.co/Rp9ZignN6D"

18,"Let’s reflect on what Dr. King truly stood for, judging people as individuals. https://t.co/gnVT3pdgIW"
19,"I’m praying for the safe release of the hostages &amp; the law enforcement officials working the scene. Terrorism like this is one of the great scourges of our time, the individual responsible must be apprehended &amp; brought to justice. This can’t be tolerated. https://t.co/b1bELuciUy"

26,"It was truly an honor to attend the late Senator Johnny Isakson’s Memorial Service today. Senator Chambliss’ recollections of their time together, spanning 50 years from UGA to the United States Senate, was truly touching. (1/2)"
27,"This week, the Fulton and Dekalb County school systems caved to the demands of the teacher's unions, the pseudo-scientists, and the fearmongering media elites by deciding to shut our children out of the schools that we pay for. It’s time for a change. https://t.co/uaPJ8PzygN"

29,"We’ve lost a Georgia giant. My deepest condolences and prayers to Dianne, his children, and the whole Isakson family.

Always putting Georgia first, Sen. Isakson was a unifier for Georgia and the nation, a true champion for Peach State families. 

Rest In Peace, Senator Isakson."
30,"This is just unamerican, and we need to stand against it. As a soldier, I swore an oath to the Constitution against all enemies, foreign AND domestic. In Congress I'll stand up for the Constitution, election integrity and the rights of States to conduct their own elections. (2/2)"
31,"The radical liberals are pushing for a federal takeover of all elections in the United States. This is blatantly unconstitutional. Make no mistake, this is a full-scale assault on the integrity of our elections here in Georgia and across the country. (1/2) https://t.co/cXgaf8XhrK"

35,Go Dawgs!
36,"Democrats love to say America is racist. That’s not true. This trial and conviction are a perfect example of how our legal system works. Nothing can bring Mr. Arbery back, but yesterday’s conviction was justice for his family and for his memory. https://t.co/8MTsMTUrG0"
37,Had a great time with the @ForsythGOP this morning. Everyone was fired up and ready to end one party rule in Washington starting with flipping the sixth! https://t.co/dXd0paK0xg
38,"relief that our justice system did not become susceptible to a biased and politically driven liberal media. Despite the left-wing media’s attempts to influence this case, going so far as seemingly intimidating the jury, justice prevailed, and the Constitution was preserved. (2/2)"
39,"Today justice prevailed, and the American justice system proved its resilience. In our great country, everyone has the individual and inalienable right to defend themselves. Kyle Rittenhouse did just that on August 25th of last year.

Americans should breathe a sigh of... (1/2)"
