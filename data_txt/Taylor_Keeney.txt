82,"‚ÄúMasking in schools was intended to be temporary, and there needs to be an exit ramp from these policies. Children have been suffering from mask effects for two years, and enough is enough.‚Äù"
83,"‚ÄúMasking kids is not a damage free intervention. It negatively affects learning &amp; causes significant social and emotional harm. Masking impairs verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and students, limits facial identification &amp; has occasional physical side effects.‚Äù"
84,"‚ÄúU.S. policy is an outlier: the World Health Organization advises against masks for kids under 5 and only selectively for kids under 11, and many European nations have kept schools open without requiring masks.‚Äù"
85,‚ÄúIt is important to acknowledge that the risk of severe disease from COVID-19 to healthy children has always been low.‚Äù
