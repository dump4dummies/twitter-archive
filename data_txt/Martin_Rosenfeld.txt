3,"@Ash8156 @pcntv It's a shame that all of the candidates weren't invited. I'm sure the voters of Pennsylvania would like to hear from all of them, not just the millionaires."
4,@PennLive Not every candidate was invited to participate in the debate. How can Pennsylvania truly be represented properly if the people don't have all of the information and know all the candidates. https://t.co/cYFMmUcdPA
5,@TheCityTroll Thank you. I feel I'm the only candidate that will actually represent the people of Pennsylvania.  As a working person who knows what other people have to deal with on a daily basis. We can no longer elect people to these positions primarily on being popular or buying the seat.

7,@TheCityTroll I didn't know about the offices in Fl and Ca. This is the start of some type of future martial law practices in which will restrict our rights even further.
8,@TheCityTroll The Capital police are being turned into a defense agency for Congress and need to be investigated as to corrupt practices used against U. S. Citizens.

27,A voting audit is absolutely essential to either confirm or refute the election results. Whatever the real results are people need to feel good about our process. Let's get it done and move on.

35,@brithume It's funny that they showed the 9 minute video to open up the trial and not the 20 minute video of the police trying to put him in the car and him fighting them off the whole time. Let the judicial system work.
