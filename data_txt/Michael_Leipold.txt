1,"@whalenonfools No, thank you Scrooge. You’re definitely trying your best at trolling and I applaud you in your efforts."
2,@whalenonfools I’d recommend getting to know me a little better before you write me off as untrustworthy though
3,@whalenonfools I’ll take that as a compliment. At least you are demonstrating some notion of discernment.
4,"@whalenonfools Well, lying to Congress to begin with. He is the head of the NIH correct? He  is a huge proponent of gain of function research as well correct? Do you really believe that he had no knowledge of what was going on through a third party entity that provided taxpayer funding to Wuhan"
5,"@EmiliaSykesOH STOP PANDERING FOR VOTES!!!! It’s bad enough that Womens rights are under attack, but to promote a BS facade to pander to a specific demographic for votes is asinine. Men do not belong in women’s sports period."
6,Fauci needs to go. He needs to be Held accountable and prosecuted

8,@RealAdCollector Do you really think a senator only represents his or her state? Fundraising and awareness is done all over the country in federal politics. Do you believe a vote in California to raise your taxes at the federal level doesn’t affect you who may live in Illinois? Interesting

14,Maxine waters needs to be removed from congress. I’m appalled by her statements that incite violence and division. We need leaders in Washington who work to unite our country-not divide. As the next senator from Ohio I will put country ahead of politics everyday.
