1,"Praise God! Religious liberty has WON!

Thankful to live in a nation that recognizes our freedom of religion and that we have brave Supreme Court justices who uphold that freedom guaranteed to us by the U.S. Constitution. https://t.co/8B1QWqvtDA"
2,Did I really just see what I think I saw? https://t.co/KJNfo0nXdv
3,Statistics show that a majority of babies who are aborted are black. Do the protestors or Senator Warnock believe the lives of black babies matter?
4,"You killed the Keystone Pipeline on day 1 in office. @senatorwarnock voted with you every step of the way. 

This has nothing to do with Putin. Stop blaming other people and look in the mirror. https://t.co/xihRZQbtPc"
5,Great to join this new rising star @imbrettcooper! She is a good kicker too! https://t.co/4edSfkhfN3
6,"You voted to cancel the Keystone Pipeline which is why gas is completely unaffordable.

You own this, @SenatorWarnock. It’s time to take responsibility for your actions. https://t.co/wtbU27v7tN"

https://t.co/bQvBKyqDPw"
11,"Warnock and Biden got us into this mess. Their policies are 100% responsible for the insane prices on gas, groceries, and everything else! Now they want us to trust them to fix it? That’s like asking the guy who lit your house on fire to put it out. No thanks. https://t.co/7KgwAJzREt"
12,It is 8.6% more expensive to be an American today than it was a year ago thanks to President Biden and Senator Warnock. We need someone with business experience representing Georgia in the Senate. https://t.co/DVGKkl0quk
13,This is so sad. Our open borders are inhumane and dangerous. Why isn’t Senator Warnock voting to secure our borders and protect human life? https://t.co/Re8fX4VQW0
14,This is unacceptable. Our Supreme Court Justices should be able to do their jobs without fear of being murdered. This is what happens when the White House refuses to stand up for what’s right and condemn what’s wrong. https://t.co/5CSHVh9o9O
15,"Gas is unaffordable, groceries are too expensive, and moms can’t buy baby formula. With all due respect, Mr. President, what “strong economy” are you referring to? https://t.co/gV2BvXKYEN"
