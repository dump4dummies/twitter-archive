1,"@douglaswburns @KimReynoldsIA Looking forward to being interviewed by you this year Doug. I always put you on my top 5 list of Iowa political journalists. Don't know who the other 4 are ... ;-) When in doubt I like to go back to Common Law, which evolved gradually over 700 years, before politicians ruined it."
2,"When politicians propose common-sense solutions to problems I assume they have no rational arguments for their proposals, but are merely blabbering to the ignorant masses. I propose federally mandated scare quotes around the words 'common-sense'. @joerogan @StephenAtHome @nbcsnl"

16,"@DMRegister A simple solution to the childcare question - get the government out of the business of regulating it. As it always does, the free market will then provide the right quantity &amp; price, for both suppliers &amp; users. Then implement a UBI to level the playing field."
17,"@ashhwu Gun violence link in Monday email is incorrect, goes to Uvalde Little Leaguers"

19,@therealpryncep1 @IAGovernor If you want legal cannabis in Iowa you can support my campaign for Iowa Governor. Ending the Drug War is one of my highest priorities.
20,"If @ChrisMurphyCT is actually serious re: reducing gun violence shouldn't he be demanding an immediate end 2 the #DrugWar, 2 eliminate the gun violence it creates from whole cloth? [Maybe the $80 billion annual savings could be repurposed for mental health care?] @RealSpikeCohen"

24,"Happy birthday to the U.S. Army. On June 14, 1775, the  Continental Congress authorized enlistment of expert riflemen to serve the United Colonies for one year. Note the timing - first we had rifles, then riflemen, then we had an army, then we had the Declaration of Independence."
25,"@modestholdings I guess that joke fell flat ... -:( first time ever! People confuse high prices with inflation, but here is not the place to elaborate on that. Milton Friedman said it all - inflation is always &amp; everywhere a monetary phenomena. Only global cuz US GDP is huge, Zimbabwe's is not."
26,Stimulus bills of $2T plus $0.9T plus $1.9T = $4.8T divided by 2 years GDP of $50T = 9.6% almost equals 8.6% inflation ... that must just be a coincidence? Numeracy is so elusive. Please share your opinion on where that extra 1% came from ...

29,"@KarinDerry4Iowa @tbreeseontv As a former LEO my personal experience is everyone you are in the process of arresting is trying to get out of it, no one is thinking of the safety of others.

30,"@tbreeseontv In factories that makes legislators, er, pies, if a pie doesn't pass strict quality control standards they throw it to the pigs. My goal is to get between the QC inspectors and the pigs, cuz those are some damn good pies."
31,"I love it when you find smoking guns like this in Iowa laws. ""The Democratic and Republican parties are exempt from this requirement."" Translation - we write the rules, we don't follow them. Your thoughts @IAGovernor @DeidreDeJear @ErinDMurphy ? @lpiowa https://t.co/lhosWSJXGp"
32,"@CourierNewsroom @JDScholten Unfortunately, popular opinion might not jibe with good public policy. What would the quickest, most effective gun violence reduction program be? I maintain, obviously, ending the Drug War, which would overnight take guns out of the hands of a million criminals. Your thoughts?"
33,"@RepCindyAxne A good first step to ending gun violence is ending the Drug War. May I ask you to support this goal? Regulating/controlling guns and ammunition is unlikely to have a measurable effect in either direction, although it does make some people feel as if they have 'done something'."
34,"If you are complaining about high gas prices (I am!) remember George Stigler's famous statement, ""Attributing scarcity to price movements is like blaming a thermometer for high temperatures."" In other words, the reason we still have gas at the pumps is because prices are up."""

47,@IAGovernor @iowa_corn @iowafuel A free market in energy would most efficiently allocate all resources. If there is a pollution problem (perhaps CO2?) it can be best ameliorated with a properly designed tax. Good economics always beats bad politics.
48,"@iowademocrats You may be right. My question is slightly different, however. Are vouchers bad for students?"
49,"In the past politicians have stuck to telling businesses what they cannot sell, now in Iowa they've moved into telling businesses what they have to sell. Still thumbing through my copy of the Iowa Constitution looking for that power @IAGovernor @DeidreDeJear @jamesqlynch"

52,"@ProgressIowa 'stronger gun laws' is quite general. Could you be more specific? Ranking your ideas from 'will save the most lives' to 'will save the fewest lives' would also be appreciated. Mine are 1) legalize suicide, 2) end the Drug War, 3) teach gun safety in schools. Thx 4 your input."
53,@robbysoave It's easy to say you would wear a mask when you are sitting in your own home speaking on the phone to a stranger who can't see your face. Much harder to do so when you are in an airport or on a plane and suddenly realize you are the only one wearing a mask who is not a weirdo.
54,"Was this Sheriff and his deputies @sbcountysheriff department committing highway robbery?  He claims not, but then why did he agree to return the confiscated $1,000,000? Clerical error?
