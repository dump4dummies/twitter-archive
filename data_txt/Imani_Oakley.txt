1,Slide through!! https://t.co/t71WePvz1m
2,RT @aj_braverman: @ImaniOakleyNJ10 @JenRourke29 If you want to help @JenRourke29 defeat this guy you can chip in here: https://t.co/DNIdS7R…
3,"The amount of violence and dehumanization one experiences as a Black woman running for office is truly unreal.

#Solidarity @JenRourke29 I’m so sorry this happened to you. https://t.co/G3affJUSil"
4,"Has anyone seen any polling on whether Roe is an issue that will realistically move conservative white women away from Republicans? 

Real question because I will never forget these numbers when a literal rapist was on the ballot in the 2016 general. https://t.co/ZJg9R81Cr8"
5,Someone may seek an abortion because they’ve been raped or they may seek an abortion because they they simply don’t want a baby and both are equally valid reasons.
6,@TiffLexi30 Facts!
7,"@TiffLexi30 From my understanding they don’t have the numbers in the Senate? I may be mistaken but your point is definitely taken.

We need a Dem party ready to fight Republicans with the same fervor they fight the most inspiring, human rights focused sect of their party."
8,"I don’t know tbh I’m angry at the Supreme Court but I’m also angry that Roe isn’t codified. 

The amount of effort to suppress the growth of the most inspiring sect of the Dem party overall leads to a weaker party and ultimately less numbers to do things like codify Roe."
9,Perpetually my generation has less rights and less rights than our parents in this country. https://t.co/GMTp33ptna
10,"Good morning 🌞 

I simply came here to say that I resent the question “is house music back” 

House music has been played at every event I’ve attended since I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey and I assure you it has never died 😂 

Thank you. Proceed with your day."

Pretending to not be a workaholic was cool for five seconds but now I have an announcement coming at you in 3…2…1…"
20,"David Wildstein wrote some of the most racist stuff on the planet towards me during my campaign &amp; sssoooo many so called “progressive” advocates still support him. 

It is what it is on some levels but it’s the theater for me. Why pretend to be anti-racist when you just aren’t?"
21,Well…I see the New Jersey political landscape is still absolutely clueless and spineless about being anti-racist…didn’t miss much I guess…

24,@AaronHyndman @delany_kate @mdkpage @JerseyDemocrats I also think some people need to not be considered leaders especially if they’re actively harmful to the overall goals. I can tell you as a person that has engaged privately publicly and in a bunch of different mediums some folks just don’t have the same end goals
25,@AaronHyndman @delany_kate @mdkpage @JerseyDemocrats 100%
26,@delany_kate @AaronHyndman @mdkpage @JerseyDemocrats I think a huge issue is what voices are listened to v. what voices are ignored especially in the journalism around here and how that leads to worse results in the end.
27,"@delany_kate @AaronHyndman @mdkpage @JerseyDemocrats This is the last thing I’ll add before getting in a nap then going to my cousin’s BBQ 😂 

I also think we take a lot of needless losses due to the loudest &amp; most covered voices in this space lacking diversity &amp; oftentimes making decisions based on personal gain not the movement"
28,@delany_kate @AaronHyndman @mdkpage @JerseyDemocrats Agree with this completely!
29,"@AaronHyndman @delany_kate @mdkpage Because you have to pay staff, pay for ads, pay for mailers, etc. 

To get these professionally done it costs money. Also in my case because the state denied me the voter file I had to pay to get that too. 

campaigns costing money is a reality we can’t ignore."
30,@delany_kate @AaronHyndman @mdkpage Ah I see. While I agree these discussions should be public I don’t think the nature of twitter lends to a productive discussion which is why I was trying to lead ppl to call or dm for a more in-depth one. So I’m going to check out but feel free to have the discussion here ✊🏾
31,"@AaronHyndman I agree Twitter isn’t the best venue for this which is why in my original thread I put to DM or text me with any additional questions to avoid this scenario but in any case I’m not exactly sure what you’re asking here? 

Here’s something that may help:

https://t.co/NNzFsqAX5t"
32,@delany_kate @mdkpage @AaronHyndman Then I’m not sure why we’re having this conversation here? This started by Aaron disagreeing? Have I missed something?
33,@delany_kate @mdkpage @AaronHyndman I’m again lost as to how this negates what I originally wrote the response to which was “I disagree”
34,"@AaronHyndman @delany_kate @mdkpage I’m deeply confused as to how any of this negates the original thread I wrote which was about money being needed to beat the line if political education doesn’t take place? 

I think people had an emotional reaction without actually taking the time to understand what I wrote…"

39,I have news: a savior is not coming. We’re going to have to collectively save ourselves
40,"Realistically it takes a multi-pronged effort and even the wins of Obama, Bernie, and AOC came after years of groundwork beforehand. 

I understand this tweet was said with respect but I implore you to study more deeply how successful movements actually come about."
41,"One of the reasons we keep losing is because we think there is going to be one savior to do it all &amp; that simply is unrealistic &amp; again doesn’t match up with history. 

It’s also why people get frustrated w/ the Obama’s, Bernie’s, and AOCs of the world when they can do magic (3)"
42,"And typically towards the end one or two people are crowned as “leaders of the movement” when in reality it took many forms of movement strategies to get something across the finish line. 

This is true of the civil rights movement as well as movements for independence (2/)"
43,"I respect your point of view. Also, what you’re describing above does not match up with how movements are won throughout history despite the fact that history books teach it this way.

Movements are typically won after years sometimes generations of grassroots organizing (1/) https://t.co/T63OuInF0i"

52,RT @4kJae: salute to @ImaniOakleyNJ10 + @DavidOcampoNJ for all of their efforts. you are appreciated.
53,"But for anyone who is interested the $2 mill number is about what it will cost for your overhead, congressional campaign things like mailers, ads, etc. and then the same for the issue campaign aspect. 

Thanks! Hit the DMs or my number if you have questions."
54,Like I said this is the last that I’m going to say on it because having the narrative that the ballot line is impossible to beat serves the interests of those who aren’t here for community work and they will fight tooth and nail to not do that work (5/)
55,So candidates are then tasks with raising at least two million while simultaneously not receiving help to achieve that number because of the self fulfilling narrative that the ballot line is impossible to beat (4/)
56,"In an ideal world grassroots orgs would actually be doing the ground work in between elections to do voter education but that doesn’t happen in NJ and the majority of the “organizing” is top heavy. 

Thus the entire job is left to candidates during their run (3/)"
57,"There are two things that are very expensive to do: run for congress (at least a mill) and run issue campaigns (can cost millions) 

When you run in NJ you have to do both at the same time because you have to get people to vote for you AND teach them HOW to vote for you (2/)"
58,"What’s up folks! 

So I know I’m not going to be believed here because the ppl have their narratives for their reasons so I’m only going to say this once and only once so it’s on record: the ballot line is not nearly as large a hindrance as money in winning elections in NJ (🧵)"
