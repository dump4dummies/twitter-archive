1,"@HecticEnergy @TrueSeeing888 In late February I went down for two days with high fever, stuffed nose, sweats, and chills. I isolated myself in my room for the entire time. No one else in the house got sick. These things effect people differently. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hear younger people are getting sick in Europe."
2,Great article on the comparison of the pandemic threat to our population. While I'm sure I will be called a pandemic denier- I believe we should all be informed and make our own assessments on how to move forward to prepare for the next event. #coronavirus https://t.co/fkqqnB1r5T https://t.co/R3lZRXtDA8
3,"@OfficialNabber @HecticEnergy @ryandonnell I‚Äôm getting annoyed by the notifications of healthy athletes being announced as having tested positive for the virus- but on the plus side, it puts everyone on alert of how badly we are prepared for a grand crisis of this kind. I live with my 78yr old mother so I am cautious."
4,@HecticEnergy @ryandonnell People die of flu every year. Mostly elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Swine flu took out many people- we didn‚Äôt shut down the country. In the end when not as many people die as with the swine flu we will claim victory because of the defensive measures taken.

6,This crisis is brought to you by the 24hr media that is making tons of money over turning a molehill into a mountain. While our working class is struggling the big media companies are doing anything to grab your attention for viewership. Time to limit their air time. #coronavirus
7,Is it time for basic subsistence supplement (BSS)? Looks like the Prez has preempted my roll out of a more descriptive name for UBI. #EndorseUBI #YangGang #BSS

9,@SenSherrodBrown @KendallScudder This senator is why we need government reform. Dinosaur thinking like this is why our government fails to provide for our citizens. Why do we need an admiral and a staff of 39 to look for pandemics when we have HHS and can partner with WHO. inefficient! #HumanityFirst #reform2020
10,It is still early but developing plans to elevate the agenda. Stay tuned for some revolutionary and strategically minded thoughts to move concepts forward. Next election cycle you will see the UBI concept front and center. #YangGang #HumanityFirst #endorseubi

15,Congratulations to @RoyceWestTX and @mjhegar Good luck to you both. Let me know what I can do to help the cause.  Please consider #EndorseUBI on your platforms. #TexasPrimary
16,"You don‚Äôt fix gun violence problems in America by taking away guns. You fix it by changing the culture of the country. Mental health support, grade school to high school. Build resiliency in our children. #gunviolence #SuperTuesday #Primary2020 #Biden"
17,I used to think that having many choices was a good thing. But what I have learned is that if you have too many choices the votes will be overwhelmed and not bother to look at the issues and just randomly pick someone. #RankedChoiceVoting #TexasPrimary #SuperTuesday
18,Getting mucho positive feedback from teachers voting for @victorfortexas based on the progressive plans for teacher pay and education for Texans. https://t.co/KW3MO4XHQl #teacher #EducationMatters #TexasPrimary #SuperTuesday Education is key for our citizens and so are teachers
19,"@rubdub9 @JamesTreakle @AndrewYang It depends on what values you are focused on. But yes, mostly."
20,"Almost 46% of voters in Texas have not decided who they will vote for in US Senate race. Decision to be made at the voting booth. It isn‚Äôt enough to vote, you must disseminate to all your contacts on every platform. #Texas #EndorseUBI #supertuesday2020 #yangang #VoteForBernie"
21,"A progressive program who‚Äôs time has come. I urge all candidates who care to being on the leading edge of the future to #EndorseUBI This program cuts across political parties, social economic standing, and basic human concerns. @BernieSanders @JoeBiden @ewarren @MikeBloomberg"
22,"No matter the results of the primary on 3 March. Don‚Äôt hold your heads down. The battle has only begun. We will come back stronger and more organized. UBI, the battle is on until the battle is won! #dem #YangGang #HumanityFirst #DemocraticPrimary #TexasPrimary #BidenForPresident"
23,@AlbertL06213191 @OfficialMLK3 @AndrewYang I have received death threats to myself and my children but I think the proper authorities have it under control. Thanks. I was a 3BDE 2 Panther myself. My daughter is currently serving with 2BDE.
24,"If you know someone who is in the education profession I ask you direct them to the web page below and look at the position paper on education. We need to make education a priority and those who contribute. #teacher5oclockclub #TexasForever #teachertwitter

25,@OfficialMLK3 @AndrewYang The only way to move this forward is to support and endorse each other and form a coalition of those willing to step up. Put it out on the airways for all to know! Divided we will not stand for long.
26,@Rowaida_Abdel WTF! Why??? Just sick!
27,"Frankly, If I‚Äôm going to listen to a politician talk they better be taking about solutions. I don‚Äôt need a talking head regurgitating the problem. I want to know what your plan is to fix it or make it better. If we asked this of all politicians we wouldn‚Äôt hardly hear from them."
28,@ArmyGuy70243913 Welcome to the new America.  You can‚Äôt let one or two people disagreeing with you drive you down. Hold fast. üçÄ
29,@AarikaSamone @scottsantens @AndrewYang That is such a sad story. I‚Äôm sure there are many more like it out there. @AarikaSamone  We need to keep pushing this forward.
30,Don‚Äôt hate America for what it is. Love it for what it can be. We have always been an imperfect democracy/republic. But it‚Äôs our drive to be better that makes America great. Not how much stock rises. Put people first. #HumanityFirst #TexasPrimary

39,@eptxyds @cristinafortx How about we double up the fun with some real progressive ideas? If your group would be open to what the future holds? I was planning on being in El Paso this week. I can certainly make some changes to introduce your group to the future. @eptxyds #yanggang #yanggangforlife
40,"@dkstoddard @BernieSanders Ok, that‚Äôs funny. No. We need to keep taxes low, and liberty high!  If we could have a progressive tax and if corporations that hide earning in tax shelters were made to pay at point of sales we could recoup a lot of lost tax revenue."
41,"@cleemonsta @BernieSanders Sorry, no one was more surprised than me. I still voted for Yang but when you‚Äôre on a team you gotta play with someone and he made the most sense of who is left. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
42,@say___e @BernieSanders None of the Presidential candidates are for UBI.....yet.
43,Just want to give my friends a heads up on interview I gave last week on the subject of what Presidential candidate I support that will come out this week. The candidate that focuses on the helping our struggling citizens. I a Bernie Bro. #BernieInTX @BernieSanders I‚Äôm all in!!

47,@BGTX @BGTXGC @MOVE_texas @OrganizeTexas Nice article; it just shows how removed those outside of Texas are thinking that Ramirez has the slightest chance of flipping the state with her overly aggressive progressive thought and lack of qualifications.

54,@olaf_anderson We need to get the big money out of our elections. I support democracy dollars because it will force us to go at the issues. Today the candidate with the richest friends get to play.
55,"@cmclymer I would think there are a lot of reasons why he won't release his full record. Least of which is his heart issues. Me, like you @cmclymer, if you had a hitch in the Army and you didn't come out broken, you didn't do it right."
56,"Surely technology has surpassed the wildest dreams of our founding fathers. Wouldn‚Äôt it stand to reason that the procedures they put in place have been surpassed as well? Rank Choice Voting is the evolution of our elections. More inclusive electorate, more choices, more parties."
57,"@PalestineMATH It's not about the amount, it's about the heart. Thank you So Much."
58,The benefits of having found your tribe is having discussions about life and policies. @MavityGM Thank you.
59,@talentsofyangg1 They didn‚Äôt ask who I was going to vote for- üòâ
60,"Sometimes a person needs to put their biases aside and just look at the issues, think out implications, and accept the results. A reporter asked who I was going to back for President. I think I‚Äôm going to have to eat some crow. ‚òπÔ∏è"
61,@Dominant_Class @UYang2020 @MavityGM You can‚Äôt just look at the bad things without looking at the good thinks. Like giving people the opportunities they don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs about giving liberty to our oppressed workers.
62,"@garrettb675 @MavityGM Yes, that is what the Scandinavian countries have. But they also have almost zero migration. So those models wouldn‚Äôt work in the US. A land of perpetual immigration."
63,@MavityGM Marxism: Socialism is the precursor to communism.  https://t.co/ymOH3Uo50A
64,@MavityGM @UYang2020 I have no problem with Bernie‚Äôs ideas. I have a problem when he wants to throw away the constitution in order to get at the systemic issues. You can‚Äôt say you want government to control the means of production and think that there is a place for the US Constitution. My thoughtsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
65,"@MavityGM It‚Äôs a fine line between the two. Bernie crossed it. You can‚Äôt attack the one institution that has created all the wealth; try to destroy it, and take its fruit. Not if you don‚Äôt want to end up like Venezuela. Dem Soc is the twin brother of Communism. I would support Soc Dem. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
66,"I have been preaching during my campaign that it‚Äôs good to Make America Great Again, but it‚Äôs even better to Make Americans Great Again! We need to focus on our people. I felt so alone- but now I feel like I‚Äôve found my tribe. Thanks #YangGang"
67,"@HersheyTaker @darthkaqoon @YGangAmerica @HouYangGang1 I am running now. I don‚Äôt know where I will be in four years. I suspect Cruz will not be running for Senate. He will run for President, which is why he supports term limits. It won‚Äôt effect him."
68,Really appreciate the support from the #YangGang. I have been self funding my campaign so far Focusing on getting the message out rather than asking for donations. But at some point the reality of the cost to travel the state of Texas hits you like a wall. https://t.co/PsNGG3Y3JM
69,@pinming Yeap. Up till 4am working on my war college school work. Thanks.
70,@JenanSkinner @YGangAmerica @HouYangGang1 I have a grassroots movement. All I ask is the dissemination of my links and let the people decide if they want to support my ideas. Disseminate throughout your friend lists. Let the people exercise their Liberty. It‚Äôs a gamble but if my strategy works it positions me for Nov.
71,"@PattyWitrado @YGangAmerica @HouYangGang1 No, you do not have to live in TX to donate. You can go through my web page to ActBlue account. It‚Äôs crunch time and I could use all the support I can get.  I have been self funding so far.  https://t.co/KW3MO4XHQl"

73,@yodaism Wise you are. üëçüèº
74,I have been focused on my campaign that I failed to fully analyze Yang‚Äôs platform After some cajoling from the #YANGYANG I see minimal differences in our platforms. I have decided that I will keep moving his ideas forward as we are so closely aligned. @YGangAmerica @HouYangGang1
75,"@GotPassport @Shenny63878803 @doctorthaker @CarrytheY Sorry, but I don‚Äôt like Bernie‚Äôs ideas of trashing capitalism. Capitalism has it‚Äôs problems but it has gotten us where we are now. I refuse to support Bernie until he wins the nomination. Then, and only then, will I be all in on Bernie. But I‚Äôm going to keep a close eye on him."

80,@mrdannyglover @BernieSanders Stick to acting.
81,"@RandPaul What the hell is wrong with you? Exactly when did the President declare war?  We, the military, took out an enemy combatant on the battlefield. If you wanted him protected you should have removed him from the terrorist list. You failed to do your job Senator!!"
82,@MaxBoot The military is an apolitical organization. The second you get yourself in the middle of partisan politics you have failed as a military officer. The LTC was justifiably removed. Had I been his supervisor I would have removed him immediately!!
83,"We investigated Russian collusion for almost three years. Now, Democrats are on the cuffs of nominating a communist to represent their party for President. What is going on!? #BernieWonNewHampshire #NeverBernie"
84,"@garrettb675 Neither are good for the USA. Communism robs the people of freedom, and socialism robs the people of hope."
85,"@BernieSanders A true communist in action. Feast your eyes on Russian collusion. The day the Democratic Party nominates this communist for President of the US, it will be my last day as a Democrat. I will start my own political party if I have to. #NeverBernie"
86,"I like a lot of Bernie‚Äôs ideas, as unrealistic as they may be. But I just can‚Äôt support a guy embarrassed to call himself a Democrat. Bernie is only a Democrat when he wants something. If he doesn‚Äôt get it- he disavows the party. I can‚Äôt support a user like that. @BernieSanders"
87,"The President delayed funds for an American ally at war, but Congress has no problem delaying funds for American troops at war? We don‚Äôt just need change in the executive office, we need change in governance. #Texasdem"

89,@RepSylviaGarcia. Awesome job. You knocked it out of the park!
90,I will hold fast that it was a stratigic blunder by Democrats to allow the Trump Republicans to have the last move on the questionable actions of the President. You never give your opponent the last move. The House should have admonished and closed the case. #ImpeachmentTrials
91,Leaders are not stopped by the color of their skin or adversity of their mission. They are not stopped by the unpopularity of their ideas. They are driven by the conviction of their believe.
