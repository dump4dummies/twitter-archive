0,The travesty of the Supreme Court's actions has at its foundation a broken democracy. How can we expect anything better when 10% of us vote in primaries? If we want a better future we must vote these wannabe authoritarians out and appoint some real Justices.
1,"Today, NY's redistricting master released maps that place my presumptive opponent, @RepPaulTonko  and ultra-conservative @EliseStefanik into the same district. For all who have hoped that Stefanik would finally get a well funded Democratic challenger, your wish is coming true!"
2,"Rar In the Field ep. 1: Freezing temperatures, high winds and beautiful meatballs couldn't stop us from getting the 2k+ signatures needed to face Paul Tonko in the Democratic Primary for NYs Capital Region (NY20). Our journey to the June 28th election has just begun! https://t.co/AoIBaE0Kyg"
3,An extraordinary #PeaceInUkraine rally in #Albany! #UkraineRussianWar #StandWithUkraine #SlavaUkraine #RussianForPeace #RarForCongres https://t.co/7VGvazyxDc

6,"As a Russian-American running for Congress, I view it as my duty to speak out on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Yesterday I recorded a podcast with @CynthiaPooler6 of @allexitsclosed and did just that. Take a listen!  #RussiaUkraine"
7,Is it a coincidence that in our country the top 10 richest Americans own $1.28 trillion in wealth while 43.2 million student debt holders hold $1.59 trillion in debt? @Ilhan
8,While others do things like refuse corporate PAC money even when everyone else in their party is happy to accept it. @Albany_DSA @TroyDSA @AOC @JamaalBowmanNY  @Sen_JoeManchin
9,Dems and Reps fighting is only one dimension of U.S. politics. The fight between the establishment status quo and true progressives is even more important. That's why some Senators sell out their own constituents even if it means going against the will of their party. #Manchin
10,"We have a major announcement to make. Our campaign is ready to start onboarding interns! If you stand for what we stand for, you won't find a better way to take the next step!

11,"A campaign that doesn't give students and young  people the first-time experience they need will fail in the long run. 

Great campaigns bridge generational divides by having a long term youth-centered vision that gives them life beyond any one candidate.

12,RT @EhresmanKatya: PSA: caring about the 'youth vote' and uplifting young staffers means not just circling through the same young staffers…
13,"For establishment politicians running unopposed, elections have become nothing more than a ""subscription renewal"". Except instead of sitting on their couch watching Netflix they get to sit in #Congress. Not so for @PaulTonko in #NY20."
14,You don't have to go far from the Capital Region to find the center of progressive politics in #NYC . But would you believe me if I told you that in a few years the Capital Region will be the new bastion of progressive politics in NYS? @AOC @JuliaCarmel__ @JamaalBowmanNY
15,"I will say it again. If elected, I will use the power of my office to lead a debt strike. It won't be just a student debt strike, but a comprehensive debt strike against medical debt, housing debt, credit card debt, predatory lending and all other forms of insidious debt. https://t.co/bCKMyaXcF9"

18,"It's twice as hard to make it through the majority White boys club of a Senate hearing when you're an Asian woman, harder yet when they imply that you're a communist, and it becomes impossible when your cardinal sin is that you believe in the Green New Deal."
19,"At last week's Working Families Party meeting several ""progressive"" Albany Councilmembers argued that the Albany Mayor can't be challenged because she has too much money... Since when was backing down in the face of money a progressive value???"
20,"When we follow in the footsteps of FDR, and expand the Supreme Court from nine Justices to some larger number. Don’t tell me about how the nine Justice Supreme Court is sacred. If a person’s right to choose the fate of their own body isn’t sacred then NOTHING is sacred."
21,"European countries where all public colleges and universities are tuition free: Germany, Norway, Iceland, Austria, France, Czechia, Slovenia, Hungary, Greece and Poland. US in-state public tuition: 10k+, out of state tuition: 26k+. What are we doing???"

24,"The Kyle Rittenhouse verdict is a dark reminder that structural racism permeates every building block of our legal system. Until we embrace anti-racism as a guiding policy principle, we will never find justice. #KyleRittenhouse"

27,While we focus on holding the murderers of #AhmaudArbery accountable and on setting an example for other would-be vigilantes; let’s not forget that unless we fix the system that empowered them to murder in the first place we won’t solve the underlying problem. https://t.co/CdJTiJmDLT
28,"This statute is an embodiment of both structural and explicit racism and must be repealed nationwide through federal legislation. 

5/5"
29,"It gets worse… the statute in question was passed in 1863 explicitly to allow white citizens to capture slaves fleeing from the south!

4/5"
30,"The statute appears to trust citizens to put aside their racism, their bias, their lack of training and make a sound judgement regarding the crime and a safe arrest…. It’s absurd. 

3/5"
31,"Georgia and NY law both allow for private citizens to arrest a person if they witness a crime or, in the case of Georgia, if the crime is committed within the person’s “immediate knowledge.” This type of statute encourages vigilantes to murder innocent people.

35,"Getting only US citizens and green card holders out of Afghanistan is not good enough. Anyone who wants to leave should be able to leave. We promised them a better life. To those who are still alive, we can still keep our promise! @POTUS"
36,I'm devastated by the stories coming out of Afghanistan. How can we do this to the people who trusted us over the last 20 years? How cold you do this to them @POTUS ?
