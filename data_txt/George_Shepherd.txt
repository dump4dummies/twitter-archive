53,@AlanJohnMcLean Quid Pro Quo Joe is a hypocrite and a lying politician. I‚Äôm none of those things.
54,@AlanJohnMcLean I read all day. I read news I don‚Äôt agree with all day. My current job affords me that luxury.
55,@AlanJohnMcLean Alito is a Supreme Court Justice. Who are you talking about??
56,@AlanJohnMcLean @GOPChairwoman Will do and always do. We appreciate the advice.
57,@AlanJohnMcLean Biden is a complete hypocrite. He voted to strike down Roe v. Wade in the 80‚Äôs and now he‚Äôs applauded at Justice Alito‚Äôs opinion. That is the definition of hypocrite.

86,@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness He controls their energy. He has them on a leash!! The USA could stop end this war in a month if we were still energy independent. Biden‚Äôs war on oil and gas is shameful. https://t.co/H1mLZwGYEs
87,@JenGriffinFNC Why are we advertising what arms we‚Äôre sending Ukraine? We fought the Soviet‚Äôs in the 80‚Äôs quietly and very successfully. I don‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôre advertising NATO‚Äôs arms shipments. These arms are being used to kill Russian soldiers. https://t.co/4N6DWSlt6N
