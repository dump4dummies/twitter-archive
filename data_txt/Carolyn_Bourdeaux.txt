0,I am honored to have delivered this district for the Democrats in 2020 and to have been able to work on behalf of #GA07 over the past year. I wish Lucy McBath all the best as she looks ahead to facing off against Republicans in November.

14,"I formed the COVID-19 task force at the start of the pandemic to advise me and help us think about the response needed for our community. We need to build on this to develop a long term, coherent strategy and the first step is making sure everyone has access to basic health care."
15,"How many people have to die before we approach disease and pandemics like adults, before we develop a coherent long-term strategy for addressing problems like this, before we make sure that everyone has basic needs met like affordable, quality health care?"
