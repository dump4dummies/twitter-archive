1,Cant claim credibility when Gov Bob Ehrlich has the sense to endorse the first Black woman GOP nominated to Congress from MD (yours truly) and you couldn’t @MichaelSteele in 2018. No wonder we never cared about the @gop until @realDonaldTrump #TrumpLegalTeam #Trump2020Landslide
2,Let the record reflect that @MichaelSteele is the least helpful person in politics. NEVER lifted a finger to help #nextgen. He has let us ALL down by caring more about his money and not about his legacy. @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani continue fighting for #America https://t.co/D6O9pl1h8W
3,Great much needed conversation @mshilary I pray all voters #listen and consider all sides. Take the time to research beyond the headlines and think what are their personal values.
