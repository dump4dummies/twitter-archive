Please consider casting your vote for our campaign so we can get this country back on track! https://t.co/Ib8v0vciBQ"
4,Inflation hits a four-decade high.  This was fueled by Biden/Titus decision to pump trillions of dollars into an over-heated economy.  And it would have been much worse had they succeeded in spending trillions more.  Time to take back the House!
5,I'm honored to be endorsed by my friend Niger Innis.  Niger has a deep understanding of how best to truly lift up Americans of all races and classes.  I know he will be a great partner to me as we seek to serve the people of NV-1! https://t.co/NyefhrsFie

16,There's a direct link between high gas prices and President Biden's bad habit of signaling to the oil and gas industry that they won't be around long enough to recoup any return on new investments.  Has he learned nothing?! https://t.co/nWD6FZSFnJ
17,Wondering why are gas prices higher than ever?  Don't look to Europe.  Look to Joe Biden and his enabler Dina Titus. https://t.co/d3cckHUPx8

31,".@dinatitus thinks #NV01 is the ""WORST district in the state""

Time to put Nevadans first https://t.co/BmbOozxMsb. #NVpol https://t.co/IVjg8iV9x3"
32,"While her first choice to be Joe Biden's ambassador may not have come through, we all know that by voting with Biden 100% of the time Dina Titus has been his Ambassador all along. 

Welcome to the race Ambassador Titus! #NV01 #NVpol https://t.co/kZEEWwVzXV"
33,".@dinatitus would much rather sit in an embassy abroad than serve the people here at home.

38,"Iran is a state sponsor of terror obsessed with confronting America and Israel.  The only thing that could make this deal worse is allowing it to be brokered by Russia and hidden from Congress.
