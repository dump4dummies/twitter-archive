Rather than making it difficult for other states to investigate if their citizen visited Washington for an abortion let’s make it illegal for them to investigate if their citizens visited. 

Sincerely,

5,"@shadow5bass I agree with you, and we need organizations to start supporting independent candidates. At the moment most ballots like the one I received yesterday in the mail have three parties on them! Democrat, Republican, or Trump Republican!

I know they have agendas I was fighting one!"

10,(3/3) we decided to drive 10.5 hours from Atlanta to DC 1PM-11PM I drove my husband only stopping once for gas to get to this moment because there was absolutely no way I was going to let him miss this moment! This man deserves all of this and moreCap and Gown coming in a bit! https://t.co/Xi1e8G1zmK
11,(2/3) We waited in 3 lines for 5 hours being pushed from one to another. They took our bags and wouldn’t give them to us. We got 2 hours of sleep Early Friday morning just to get back to the airport from a hotel to be on standby! After two flights and not getting on either
12,(1/3) On Thursday my husband and I left Seattle heading for DC for one mission for him to walk across the stage to get for his Masters Degree. We went through hell to get here to this moment! Thursday @Delta delayed and then canceled our flight after landing in ATL!

14,@john_jseagraves @Delta The bag is off the plane downstairs and flights are still landing!
15,This is crazy @Delta is holding our baggage and refusing to give it to us because they won’t pull any more bags until tomorrow!
16,@john_jseagraves @Delta I fly @Delta all the time this is the first bad experience I have had and it is a massive mess up!
17,Wow @Delta your failing at every step! We just waited an hour@in the line at the gate desk as we were told to rebook our flights and an hour later you close the desk and force us to the help desk line to wait 2-3 more hours? @Delta this is ridiculous https://t.co/F0inMNznkg

22,@john_jseagraves @Delta Our pilot is doing his best to help us but @Delta doesn’t seem to have contingency plans at their own home hub!
23,@john_jseagraves @Delta We just want to know what @Delta is doing to get us in the air!
24,Flight DL464 to DCA @Delta
25,Can @Delta help us understand what has happened and what failures took place today for this to happen to the point our flight team has timed out and we need a new crew (more delays)! @Delta can you fix this in real time?
26,"Once the app changed we had to rush back because of another change with a departure again in 10 minutes! We left our drinks (having two sips) @Delta then delayed us again and sent us to a 3rd gate! (6 hours later, 3 gates, and lots of app updates) We are still sitting here!"
27,"Stranded at #ATL ATM! @Delta we sat for 2 hours on the tarmac heading to #DCA, and then we got off the plane due to more delays. @Delta app sent us to one gate with a departure in 5 minutes, once we got to that gate Delta sent us back to A24 after we got drinks waiting for a ✈️!"

30,"@JAMESCALLISTUS2 Are you saying that Republicans haven’t banned books, or voted to control womens healthcare, or passing voting laws that make it harder to vote? 

I can give you references to each one these instances where republicans have passed laws to take control!"
31,"@JAMESCALLISTUS2 There is a typo it’s says Democrats but —
Republicans are the one banning books
Republicans are ones creating laws to control a person’s healthcare.
Both parties control media - Republicans have FOX Dems have MSNBC 
Republicans are the ones passing laws to “fix election fraud”"
32,@CallForCongress When it comes to centrists they sound a lot like a Republican when it comes to the same issues!
33,@_ashawndabney Doing well…fighting the good fight and pushing for a better tomorrow for all each and every day! Happy Saturday! Hope you and your family are doing well!
34,@CallForCongress It’s not only time for impeachment it’s time to regulate the regulators!
35,@CallForCongress It’s a corporate administration with corporate people in power and a corporate congress! Of course they don’t see what is right in front of them they don’t have to worry about the impacts it has on regular Americans!
36,@_ashawndabney Good morning!
37,New rule: Those who put “Let’s go Brandon” stickers on their cars are now to be called Brandon! Time to turn the tables on stupidity!

39,@queekie1 Thanks for your opinion!
40,@queekie1 No thank you! I am who I am and being “discreet” is not that! You wouldn’t ask a straight person to “be discreet” so why ask a non-straight person to be?
41,Throughout my campaign some people told me to just not say I’m gay…I didn’t listen to them because I am my authentic self and I can’t honestly fight for equity if I can’t be honest with you! When we are our authentic selves we can #BeTheChange
42,Correction I was intending to ask @TheJusticeDept not @DOJ!
43,Greetings @CNN @MSNBC can we get as much coverage for this young man as we did for gabby? https://t.co/N50h7twPuN
44,“U.S. Marshals providing 'around-the-clock security' at Supreme Court justices' homes” DOJ says. Where is the around-the-clock security for our children @USMarshalsHQ @DOJ what is more important an adult who chooses not to defend himself or a child who can’t?
45,We spend millions to protect adults in public office but can’t seem to be pass a bill to protect our children!
46,"When @CNN uses gun crime to put together news feeds dilutes the issues of Mass Shooting like Uvalde, Buffalo, Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, and so many more! Do we need to address gun reform ⭐️YES⭐️ but let’s not dilute the issue!"
47,@CallForCongress It is caused by false information and the continuing attack on progressive values by both republicans and centrist moderate corporate democrats!
48,RT @Teknowledge420: This really shows a difference in generations we all grew up in. https://t.co/Zec9tEbQjv
49,@shadow5bass There is only one difference between the civilian-style assault rifle vs a military assault rifle and that is the number of rounds fired in a single trigger pull. Let's not parse words here they both shoot the same bullet and are designed for killing people!
50,Until we fix gun laws NEW RULE: If a person is in a school with an assault rifle they are a threat and should be terminated with extreme prejudice! DO NOT SET UP A PERIMETER TAKE THAT PERSON OUT!

53,@Loligag041 @comcast Hi there! Let’s go back to Kindergarten and read the full sentence! You forgot about Women! Now let’s look at History probably not taught to you! Straight White Men have held power for to long! It’s time for equity so please shut your mouth and read a book on fixing your bigotry!
54,@TomSwickrath @comcast It’s neither it’s called equity! I know it must hurt you to see equity being a straight white man but let’s face it bigot boomers are out and the millennials are in!
55,@grizzlymamabear @comcast They are literally adding you in it Elisabeth! WOMEN is right before people of color! Wow do you really need something to yell@discrimination about? If so yell the the Supreme Court for controlling your body! #karensgonewild

62,"Trying to reach 15k followers this week, as we start to turn a new corner and get ready for a giant reveal! Can you help us reach that?"
63,I’m infuriated to the point of tears thinking about the pain and torture these 19 children and 2 teachers went through while the police did nothing! We want answers! The last two school shootings the police failed to act! WE DEMAND CHANGE!
64,@mcramony @SenateDems @SenateGOP @Sen_JoeManchin @SenSchumer 19 children deserve every representative and senators explanation on why they lost their life! Each and every Dem and Rep in congress owes them an answer! It’s time for change!
65,The day corporations and money get out of politics will be the day the country actually works for the people!
66,@shadow5bass @SenateDems @SenateGOP I couldn’t agree with you more!
67,@GOP This is your talking point? 19 children are dead and you want to talk about gas prices! You cowardly Pieces of S***t
68,@mcramony @SenateDems @SenateGOP @Sen_JoeManchin This is on every single one of them! They are all elected let’s not split hairs! They all owe us answers!
69,"@Bakari_Sellers No, it is still with me everyone of these are still with me. It’s why we must end the corporate establishment in DC!"
70,When do our children come before politics @SenateDems and @SenateGOP? When do children come before your donors? We the people want to know! We your constituents want to know! WE DEMAND ANSWERS!
71,"@nyladavis1990 Most definitely, as a parent it took every ounce of me to not go pull my son out of school as soon as the reports came out!"
72,This right here pisses me off! It’s bad enough Texas is the Wild West but to not protect children is a different story! This is sickening!!!!!!! https://t.co/mLVXxMWFVh
73,@SmileyForWA This Democrat Military Family does not want your prayers! Push to ban assault rifles on h wait your backed by trump and the rest of the GQP so guns are more important than your children!
74,@CallForCongress I tried to get on the ballot to take down Patty but couldn’t do it! Maybe we change it in 2 years?
75,"@SeaPPC Hi David,
I am a true progressive, I may have had to end my campaign but my fight for equity will not end. My campaign was built because of the corp Dems and the establishment not doing anything for our under represented communities. I will continue to fight for change!"
76,@tPAs4AgCFyrCnj5 Then why blindly follow your party? That is my point. Please don’t try to split hairs both sides have their reasons to blindly follow. If you choose to do so don’t be angry at those on the other side!
77,@SpryOld @islandlife2014 Not a false equivalency! And they are not both parties are the cause but you would know that what they have done actually affected you!
78,@tPAs4AgCFyrCnj5 Defense of marriage act and the ‘94 crime bill! a more recent representation of the party! And civil rights have not progressed since that bill!
79,@tPAs4AgCFyrCnj5 There is the problem right there! Republicans think it’s fine to allow the KKK and they think we are the bad one for allowing Gays like myself into the party. Different views same blindly following issue! QUESTION EVERYTHING AND DO YOUR RESEARCH!
80,If you blindly follow your party do you have any right to call out those who do it on the other side?
81,@ArnoldSpence31 @KimWats45516655 @GovKathyHochul We would first need a fair and impartial judicial system!
82,If you are a Dem and you get upset at Dems calling out Facts about Dems and demanding answers you are part of the problem not the solution!
83,@Rick4USSenateOH It’s all Corporate and establishment Dems! It’s not just two!
84,@ArnoldSpence31 @KimWats45516655 @GovKathyHochul An individual is not a well formed militia so therefore the 2nd Amendment should not apply regardless and assault weapons should be banned!
85,@nobleeffort55 It’s all of the corporate Dems as my point stated don’t defend them they have the power to do something they are choosing not to and allowing two Dems to go off the handle! It’s a political stunt!
86,When you defend someone for their inaction you are only hurting those who are affected by it! Stop defending do nothing Corporate Dems! They have the power to do something they have chosen to tell you they can’t!

89,@shadow5bass While I understand your point do we really want to keep allowing the police to police themselves?

93,Once again we are mourning the loss of life at an elementary school! It’s time for gun reform it’s time to end the violence!
94,I told you all that I wasn't going to stop and I am not I have some big news coming in the weeks ahead. I need to finish shutting down the campaign and I am going to take a quick break for the remainder of the WA Primaries. I will let you know what coming before I take a break!

96,"@northNJtrack That was the ‘60’s the current Centris have taken Gay marriage away ‘96 DOMA, helped stoke the flames of inequalities and school to prison pipeline by voting for the ‘94 crime bill. The centrists also don’t support M4A, Green New Deal, and other issues that help build equity!"
97,@northNJtrack Yeah those deals are how we got where we are today at near destruction of our country! So the deals that have not given us progress are the ones that gave us Trump! But good job at trying to shift the blame! It’s been the centrist “deal makers” in power for 30+ years now!
98,This is only the beginning! We cannot stop the fight for equity because we lost a single fight we still have a war against power to win.
99,"@GodSavetheUSA1 After many attempts to get the funds needed to get on the ballot, we are not able to achieve that. I am sorry my friend, I can only hope that we will hold the seat here in WA as dem even if it is a person who is doing nothing for us."
