2,"Odd that my supporters and I are being attacked after the election. What are they so afraid of? The greatest liberating technologies, like the internet itself, can be used for good and evil. Monero is the free speech money that we need to preserve our liberty in the digital age. https://t.co/KwCPtQwQaN"

5,@NickArcodia Research deeper and you will see Monero is staying ahead of the tracing companies. They admit not being able to deterministically trace Monero. Bitcoin has completely failed to thwart tracing.
6,"@NickArcodia But Btc can effectively be controlled. You can send your btc to any address, sure,  but you may get a knock on your door. We are already seeing this. It‚Äôs not theoretical. Not to mention mining centralization. Monero fixes Bitcoin‚Äôs flaws."
7,@NickArcodia They track your bank accounts but cash still gives you some liberty. In a digital dollar or bitcoin world where cash is eliminated all transactions will be tracked. Tyranny is not some far fetched fear. Big tech is already surveilling and censoring communications. Money is next.

12,@ladyjazz215 Cryptography lets people communicate secretly. Cryptocurrencies enable the communication of value without any third party involved. Bitcoin was the first. I can send you btc with no bank/Corp involved. Monero does it better because it keeps the sender/reciever and amounts hidden
13,@JLagaert @cakewallet One reason: it‚Äôs not on Coinbase where the masses purchase crypto. Whereas useless Coins like litecoin go up because it‚Äôs easy to acquire. For those that understand the fundamental value of Monero this as an opportunity to accumulate monero before it becomes more accessible.
14,"To my non-crypto followers: Monero is digital gold. Gvmnts/corps can‚Äôt take, track, or stop You from transacting it. It is free speech money. Twitter/Facebook accounts are being shutdown. What‚Äôs next? Use cryptography to preserve your liberty. Ask your crypto questions here:"
15,As bitcoin goes mainstream there is a war happening against Monero‚Äîthe cryptocurrency that the establishment fears and that must prevail to preserve our liberty in the digital age. I ran for Congress to protect our liberty. I spread Monero awareness for the same reason. https://t.co/5Syz1hkm3M
