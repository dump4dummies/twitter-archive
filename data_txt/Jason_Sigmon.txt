22,"Where do we go from here?
 
I predict Xi continues to talk tough because an invasion of Taiwan is a poison pill for China.
 
Although Russia could potentially get away with annexing more territory, China has more to lose than to gain by invading Taiwan."

Meanwhile, China has stolen, developed, and bought advanced weapons and technology that allow them to compete on the global stage."
