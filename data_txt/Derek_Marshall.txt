1,"In the days since Roe was overturned we've had a Senator come out and say they support segregation in schools. We cannot continue to allow these kinds of people in positions of power, it is a danger to us all."
2,"@marwilliamson @Angelica4CA @DavidKimForCA @Maebe_A_Girl Thank you Marianne! It should be a great night, and I'm looking forward to it."
3,@simsfornevada It was so great meeting you. Let's both win this!
4,"Good morning! Here is your reminder that with dems in control of the the House and Senate they have to power to codify Roe. If they don't, we have the power to hold all politicians accountable."
5,"Another great turnout for abortion rights in the High Desert. It‚Äôs these young activists that are the future of our country, filling the political vacuum that has been left by a generation of neglect in rural and exurban communities. There are a helluva lot of us out here ü§†üåà https://t.co/ezADAacii0"
6,The right to abortion being gutted during Pride month does not feel like a coincidence. Clarence Thomas' opinion has shown us that so much more is at stake. We must organize.
7,"Forcing people to give birth when there is no baby formula on the shelves, no paid parental leave, and for profit healthcare is absolute villainy."
8,@simsfornevada üíØüíØüíØ
9,Everywhere I look I see politicians who speak on the evils of inflation and then vote no on ending price gouging. Could not be me. Why? Well I don't take any money from Big Oil or other corporations.
10,Volunteers from our campaign organized the Roe March in our district a couple days ago. Their efforts and the connections built organizing are how we bring about change. So proud of the work they're doing. https://t.co/rzQe1bIx07
11,No consequence for not reading Miranda rights. States cannot pass gun safety laws. No abortion. Cops called to protests before they even begin. Tell me what rights do the people still have?
12,Here is your friendly reminder that charging exorbitant amounts of money for medicine needed to live is a death sentence for thousands and the US is one of the only countries to do it!
13,"Oligarchy is when a group of elite politicians and their corporate donors, in the richest country on earth, force the majority of people to live paycheck to paycheck, stack the courts, and overturn legal precedents that take away rights supported by that majority."
14,Inaction is action. Legislators need to remember that we are all watching. Now they need to show us what they're going to do to protect the millions at risk following these major Supreme Court decisions or face the consequences from their constituents.
15,@nvdems @Edwin_Lyngar @La_Rue_Hatch @simsfornevada It was great to come out! Thanks for having me.
16,"If you know of any protests or demonstrations going on today, add it below this tweet and then share so everyone can get organized!"
17,"Roe v. Wade was the basis of so many rights like birth control, same sex intimacy, and gay marriage. This is and has always been about more than just abortion."
18,Many of our parents and grandparents have now gained abortion rights and had them taken away in their lifetime.
19,In America a gun has more autonomy than a person. Sickening.

End the filibuster, codify Roe.

End the filibuster, codify Roe."

22,It always has been. https://t.co/BDq7mG6Br2
23,"It is up to all of us now to reverse the fascist and authoritarian direction of our government. The radical right has organized for decades and are reaping what they have sowed. By coming together, organizing, and putting in the ground work, we will defeat them."
24,"RT @HDPDems: Via Planned Parenthood:

It happened. The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade and ended our constitutional right to abort‚Ä¶"

It is no coincidence that we are watching abortion rights fall the same year the most anti-trans/lg‚Ä¶"

37,"We knew this was coming, but it doesn't make this decision hurt any less or make it any less terrifying. This decision will do immense harm and in its wake we must organize. Abortion is a human right."
38,We must act. https://t.co/eTk9JJgU7n
39,Now is a good time to #CancelStudentDebt
40,Organized labor movements are the best way for workers to reclaim their power and make the change they need in the workplace. Legislators can help their efforts by passing the #ProAct
41,Across the US legislators and lobbyists are preparing for the decision that ends abortion rights. The Right to Life Committee has a horrifying proposal &amp; 26 states can swiftly move to end abortion. But we've been organizing too. Go to https://t.co/aKRqiwPxFe to find events.
42,As the Jan. 6 hearings get pushed to July I'm thinking back to this local demonstration I joined following Jan 6. People of many backgrounds showed up to support voting rights and democracy. It is this unity and organized support that will ensure a future for democracy. https://t.co/od1jogtf4s
43,Forcing people to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth when we have a for profit healthcare system and offer zero financial or structural support after the birth is class warfare.
44,Good morning all! The days may start getting shorter but the climate crisis is not going away. Communities all around the globe NEED green policy like a #GreenNewDeal
45,"RT @RepRoKhanna: Despite the rise in horrifying mass shootings and firearm deaths, SCOTUS just struck down a state law requiring gun owners‚Ä¶"
46,SCOTUS overturning a law requiring a license to carry a concealed weapon is immoral. It makes us all less safe. The radical rightwing direction that the judicial branch has taken should be a huge concern for every single one of us. We need to organize.
47,"Millions are uninsured or underinsured. The climate is in crisis. Rent skyrockets while wages stay low. 

When the system does not work for the people we must change it."
48,LA Quinta WON their union election! Shout out to the amazing workers and organizers like Ande who have succeeded in bringing the first unionized Starbucks to the Inland Empire. https://t.co/nV30fSCQdr

But some say it's gay and trans people who are the problem?"

55,I am so proud and excited to announce our campaign's endorsement from Congressman @tedlieu! It's great to have the support of Congressman Ted Lieu as we both fight for better futures for our communities. Together we win! https://t.co/MM3wXUxZJG
56,For profit healthcare put a price tag on life. A universal healthcare system like Medicare for All is the only moral option.

https://t.co/XP7Px6oegI https://t.co/aiEHxplHMG"
64,If there is one benefit to the terror of corporate greed it is that it has inspired thousands to organize. People are suffering and have been suffering for far too long. Organizing our communities is how life saving change will be made.

69,"Other campaigns organize to win a vote, we are organizing for a community and to make sure there will always be a path towards a brighter future. 

THAT is the difference between a corporate and Super PAC funded campaign and a people powered movement."
70,This Pride Month Starbucks has attempted to inhibit union elections by threatening to take away trans workers' gender affirming healthcare benefits. Truly vile. I stand with works. I stand with the trans community. I stand with unions. Always.
