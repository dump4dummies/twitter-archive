4,@Lunch77Beatz @VirginNerdz @LiamHealy16 Perfectly said.
5,"@LiamHealy16 Although others have the character and talent, none have the charisma and business savvy of the young Conor.  That was a once in a lifetime level of self-confidence, determination, visualization, and pure knowledge “the game”. Doubt we’ll ever see all of that again w/ the talent."

7,"@JackSquatch79 @derek_farrell @ChrisKBestIKnow @DadeTeflonDon @NateDiaz209 And I should add that I am a two decade fan of BJ and am not taking away from his accomplishments.  Fighting a man at 225 pounds, as small as BJ is, is huge.  A feat most fighters wouldn’t even begin to think of trying. And it’s still okay to say he “fought a HW”."
8,"@JackSquatch79 @derek_farrell @ChrisKBestIKnow @DadeTeflonDon @NateDiaz209 Well gee-whiz.   I guess BJ has it wrong then.  I wonder if we should tell BJ Penn that his fight was AT heavyweight, instead of being an Open weight class that included someone that weighed in as a HW and someone else that weighed in lighter.  https://t.co/8tzOvrnTo6"
9,@JackSquatch79 @derek_farrell @ChrisKBestIKnow @DadeTeflonDon @NateDiaz209 The fight was at Heavy/OPEN WEIGHT.  BJ was 190 pounds. Lyoto was 225.
10,@JackSquatch79 @derek_farrell @ChrisKBestIKnow @DadeTeflonDon @NateDiaz209 Penn didn’t go to heavyweight for that fight.  He was 190 lbs to Lyoto’s 225. And he was more of a natural 155-170 pounder.

21,"@StopAntisemites @Imamofpeace @Ilhan @IlhanMN @justicedems I am not a fan of Omar, but what’s wrong about not wanting to punish the Russian people, many of whom are taking to the streets in protest of their government?

You seem to be looking for answers and not for comparisons, which is reasonable and should be what each of us are doing. I know the Twitterverse isn’t the place for long winded dissertations, but have you any ideas for the next step?"
24,"@Esakoodee @MrAndyNgo @choeshow I may be reading this wrong but it sounds to me like the poster isn’t saying this is BECAUSE of capitalism, but in spite of capitalism. To be said another way, “America, with endless ways to get ahead, looks like that”. Maybe I’m wrong but I think that’s the point being made."

43,@sleepingonsofa @oocmma But that’s just me.
44,"@sleepingonsofa @oocmma Hahahaha.  That’s a fair question.  Nicely done.  I guess I could say that I believe the Conor we saw early on was the real deal.  The one we see now is an absolute performance.  Same with Poirier.  I don’t like the “awe shucks” version.  I like the grinder, the gangster, etc."
45,"@barnellbaptiste @oocmma I’d like to see Poirier win because it’s been a long road to the title for him and he’s put  in the work.  I don’t care to see him and C-Mac fight again.  Unless Conor changes things up, the same outcome will happen."
46,@oocmma C-Mac nuthugger here.  I’ve also been a huge Poirier fan for a couple years now.  Seemed like a genuine guy and legitimate warrior.  He seems a little fakey to me nowadays.  But FairPlay to the dude. Legit put Mac down for the count. Hope it’s a great fight and worth the $.

48,"@INCagefighting @arielhelwani It can be argued Alvey is a fan favorite.  He’s got a schtick that people like, he’s got a social media presence, and he’s personable.
