21,"Congratulations to my friend and fellow Navy SEAL Ryan Zinke for winning his primary in Montana last week! I’m honored to be in a class of SEALs running for Congress this year. 

@RyanZinke @derrickvanorden @MLuttrellTX @EliCraneAZ https://t.co/R7AHdxlJTU"
22,Had a great time speaking at the Republican Club of SW Volusia earlier this month. We are hearing it everywhere. There is a leadership vacuum in DC and we need more  strong patriots in our nation’s capital. https://t.co/oh9jfD7QQR

6. Deport criminal aliens
7. Defund sanctuary cities"
36,My kids need an ID to borrow a library book. Every citizen should have to show ID to vote.

39,"Our Founders envisioned a citizen legislature. So why are Members of Congress in their seats for 20, 30 even 47 years? This is not a Democrat or Republican problem, it's a Constitutional problem. I support a Constitutional Amendment establishing term limits for all fed positions."
40,"🚨Breaking: A federal judge out of the great state of Florida has struck down Biden’s mask mandate for travelers.

The CDC is desperate to hold on to power and We the People are in the crosshairs. It's long past time to lift the mandates, let people make their own decisions."

44,"It costs Julie and me $220 to fill up our SUV right now. We pay $50 a day to drop off and pick up the kids from school 2x a week 40 minutes away! $50! It’s not an exaggeration. And that’s before groceries, doctors appointments, sports and other commitments. https://t.co/c0UmoZaWhk"
45,"I fully support a Constitutional Amendment setting term limits for Congress, but that’s not enough for true accountability. It’s time to end lifetime bureaucrats. A civil servant job should be in service to our country, not service to ones self."
46,Reminder to Vice President and “border czar” Kamala Harris… there is still an open invasion and humanitarian crisis at the southwest border that demands your immediate attention.
47,"Inflation is at record high &amp; the only ones not feeling it are in Congress. While we are paying +10% more for gas, groceries &amp; electricity, Congress increased their budgets by over 20%. This is not OK. We need honest leaders rooted in purpose &amp; service. https://t.co/yGCynGNNd1"

50,Join me at 2:15 on @newsmax to discuss the crisis in Ukraine and the realignment of global security.
51,Florida has some of the strongest government sunshine laws on the books. I think Congress should be subject to the same kind of accountability and that the FOIA should cover Congress.
52,Make America Energy Independent Again! 🇺🇸
53,Seeing Congress' complete mishandling and ineptitude dealing with every major issue throughout the last year is overwhelming proof we need a Constitutional amendment establishing term limits.
54,RT @AlecLace: “I believe we should leave an inheritance for our children’s children &amp; I think we’re not on track to do that as a country” -…
55,Few people in this world can speak of the horrors of communism better than the freedom-loving Cuban- and Venezuelan-Americans right here in Florida. The fact that the Biden Admin is seeking to fund Venezuela's Communist regime is unAmerican &amp; frankly an insult to our own people.
56,President Biden is trading one evil for another in his quest to increase foreign oil supplies.
57,"I fully support the Florida Surgeon General's assessment that healthy children do not need to take the vaccine. This is a time when kids should be building their immune systems, not being pumped with experimental drugs.

60,In fact: we take the blood oath to *support and defend* the Constitution. I support legislation to reinstate troops who were fired for refusing to take the vax and ensure that troops are not discharged for being unvaccinated in the first place.
61,The military vax exemption process is a total sham. Not a single religious exemption has been granted and hundreds of troops have been fired. Members of the military do not sacrifice their Constitutional rights when they enlist. https://t.co/LeQJyrUZP0
62,We have the best governor. No contest. https://t.co/gBQhCi6wqj

68,"Anyone who thinks the Constitution and the Bill of Rights don't matter, look no farther than the treatment of the peaceful protesters of the Freedom Convoy in a supposedly free nation."
69,"(3/3) US combat is not an option for me, but we could have:
1. Treated our ally like the friend they are
2. Forced NATO to do its job
3. Stopped Nord Stream 2
4. Implemented hard sanctions when it mattered
5. Supplied &amp; trained our ally w/ weapons systems that deter &amp; defend"
70,"As a combat veteran what really gets to me is if the United States showed strength and resolve early, rather than allow Putin to move inch by inch, this may have been avoided. (2/3)"
71,Please join me in praying for the people of Ukraine. War should not be looked at lightly or covered like sports in the press. The physical and psychological effects it will have on the people will be lasting.  (1/2) https://t.co/u9xBWHYp9Z

74,Only US citizens should be able to vote in US elections.

76,America is Exceptional. I refuse to compromise on that.  #NeverQuit https://t.co/HeXPWGNeJF
77,We are far from the Mexico border in FL but due to the crisis at the SW border every town is a border town. Case in point: FL ranks second in the number of overdose deaths. Those drugs aren’t coming here legally. They are being smuggled in by cartels. https://t.co/6Gcsm3l4fy

93,"Biden’s failure in Afghanistan has laid a heavy burden on the men and women who fought and lost friends there.

94,"They welded those gates shut knowing there were Americans still on the ground. Biden said the evacuation was an ""extraordinary success,” and to hear that from the President knowing that there are Americans still on the ground there is absolutely embarrassing. https://t.co/QOWcblZ1Iu"
