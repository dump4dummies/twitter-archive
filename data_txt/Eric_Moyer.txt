9,"@markwarschauer @JonHaidt I‚Äôm not changing arguments. Your tweets are very cryptic &amp; it took awhile to understand what your actual complaint was.

10,@markwarschauer @JonHaidt His research suggests that teen girls from 13-16 were most impacted. How does your graph of male teens from 13-19 and female teens from 13-19 contradict this claim? What makes you think suicides are a good substitute metric when gender differences are already well established?
11,@markwarschauer @JonHaidt You‚Äôre looking at a different metric that lumps all teens together. It‚Äôs not clear why you think one should expect the trend to be consistent in that dataset given the known gender variation in suicide rates.
12,"@nhashem @kozad86 @AnneNotation Most of the people voting in that election had probably voted for Ashford at some point before, not to mention that his endorsement across the aisle probably got way more local organic media than Biden‚Äôs completely expected endorsement.

13,@kozad86 @AnneNotation @nhashem There‚Äôs zero chance that Bernie would‚Äôve endorsed if her campaign didn‚Äôt want him too. Suburban voters were likely the most influenced by their former local congressman endorsing the Republican. Why do you dismiss that but insist on the veracity of the rumors you‚Äôve heard?
14,@markwarschauer @JonHaidt There have been gender differences in suicide rates for as long as that metric has been collected. Women attempt more but men complete more. That gender-effect in suicide rate is shown in your graph. What point of his is contradicted by that? https://t.co/1y0IPuEtaz https://t.co/v8uFZTlmZ2

60,@1_Man_Double Okay then why would Turner have the power to jeopardize Biden‚Äôs agenda?
61,@Purify_toast17 That‚Äôs one option. Another option is to work to change the direction of the party so that it actually lives up to its stated values and policy goals.
