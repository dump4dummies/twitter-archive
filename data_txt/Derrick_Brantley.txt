4,@SouSouSoukup @feverin @VHammercock @DavidOAtkins ‚ÄòPoised to gut the EPA‚Äô. Thats widely speculative and misleading. They could just as easily say ‚ÄòYes its constitutionally legitimate that the executive has ability to regulate greenhouse gases‚Äô.  I assume youre referencing W. Virginia vs EPA?

6,@VHammercock @DavidOAtkins The ‚Äònominally‚Äô work together is the important part. Most states barely communicate and 90% of America pokes fun at each other. Thats the beauty of it. You look at that nominal as the negative - I look at it as the most beautiful part of our Union. TX and CA still work together.
7,"@DavidOAtkins This is where you‚Äôre wrong. This issue has ALREADY been decided by the SAME judges at SC - states have no right to sue for carry over effects.

8,@DavidOAtkins ‚ÄòYoure wrong‚Äô. Solid defense. Just‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòYoure wrong‚Äô.. So easy. All the extreme right also said states legalizing marijuana would lead to their white daughters being raped by black ppl - that was an actual campaign. You sound just as hysterical.
9,@jhollymc Biased - like much radical dribble (right or left). https://t.co/i2hLU0fwsh
10,@DavidOAtkins Its only the radical left (you) who thinks this issue in of itself is so decisive that the country will invariably collapse. That is just insanity. I hope you live in one of the states that enjoy their state right to legalize marijuana and can smoke a bit to calm down?
11,@DavidOAtkins .. the constitution to affirm negative rights. The Roe v Wade decision in a backward way forced the govt to extend reach over a negative rights issue. Theres enough moderates in the middle who understand this. A civil war/balkanization unlikely w/o the middle choosing a side.
12,@DavidOAtkins This is slanted and bias. I disagree. States‚Äô ability to craft their own policy is exactly what will prevent balkanization. The jurisprudence used to justify slavery was the affirmation of a positive right (slave owners) against a negative right (slaves).. The founders framed..

40,@bgmasters @seanzy25255 Seems like the goal is to create an exodus of Border Patrol agents and further strain their effectiveness. Making them fearful of job security makes the workforce start searching elsewhere in an industry already strained for labor.

Seems your mad w/ the exclusion of Robby and not GOP as a whole. Supporting me would make sense in this situation."
55,@blackburnmanor That was a primary debate. I‚Äôll be at the general election debate. I appreciate your support for your preferred candidate but I don‚Äôt think mudslinging is very productive right now. You could have also caught me at City Club - I‚Äôll be at many future events as well. I‚Äôll holler.
56,@blackburnmanor Robby wasn‚Äôt the target - not a secret. Regardless if ppl voted for him or not shouldn‚Äôt preclude inclusion. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for people to figure out w/ a little dig. Connect ex-candidates w/ current candidates and look at the court filings. GOP is stuck - not their fault.
57,"@blackburnmanor I spoke privately w/ GOP heads here and pushed, on my end, for his inclusion. The issue is more convoluted than appears on the surface.

62,Biden‚Äôs weaponization of Section 232 is dangerous. Trump fought hard for this to defend the American steel industry from Chinese market influence. It‚Äôs now being used to target anything that doesn‚Äôt fit within the left-wing New Green Deal - including oil and materials. #tn5
63,"@GumbyPI @robbystarbuck Like I said. Lots of weird stuff. Wether people vote for Robby or not is up to them - let them decide. A lot of this could have been avoided if Ortagus didn‚Äôt get brainwashed, by whoever got in her ear, that running in TN was a good idea."
64,@robbystarbuck Seems like they‚Äôre dug in and just trying to make an example at this point. I think they‚Äôre trying to avoid Ortagus and others using your suit as a weapon to get back on. Weird stuff all around though.
65,@joy21_22 @RetiredNikitaM @McConaughey Not Matthews fault. Like many Americans; he is heart broken at the situation - especially in his home town. The issue is White House wanting to immediately capitalize on that emotion and parade him in front of cameras to scream for gun control. They are ambulance chasers.
66,Fantastic that San Fransisco is wising up and ousting their woke DA. The disastrous easy on crime policies that led to drug infested streets and mass robberies was too much for them. This should be a case study for any DA wanting to travel the same path.
67,@RepJerryNadler Pretty sure abortion still has that honor.
68,"I understand @McConaughey has an emotional link to Uvalde; but ceding ground on 2A is unacceptable. Parading Hollywood types in front of White House teleprompters, who just 4 years ago advocated for a ban on all rifles, does little to help your bipartisan appeal. We know the aim."

87,Remember this; the independent is hard to corner. They aren‚Äôt swayed by hyperbole or extrapolative argument. Shock statements of far left or far right nature have little affect since they hold no party loyalty. They are hard to convince and harder to get to the polls in number.
88,I appreciate speaking with people who are awake about whats going on in the country right now at the root level - the agenda. The question is; how do we get the others off the fence? The independent on the fence is a candidates greatest weapon. They swing elections. #tn5
