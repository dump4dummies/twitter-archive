2) That is not what the opinion says. It says those cases are NOT tied to this ruling but that they use similarly bad justification &amp; reasoning regardless of opinion"
1,"@vii_xxv_mmxix @trey_mccrae25 @DrJenLincoln The mom already can leave the baby - it is 100% legal for a mother to surrender her child to the state or to adoption.

Stop making up fake problems that don’t exist."
2,“😡American law and our system of checks and balances have worked exactly as they were meant to - federal overreach and legislating from the bench has been stopped and power has been given back to each individual state! 🤬Nooo!” - Liberals today.
3,"@Doug19463 @natsechobbyist When have I ever said anyone has the right to do that? 

I haven’t. You’re a liar and a fraud."
4,@Liberalthelorax @DrJenLincoln Define the term “man” and explain why it disqualifies a person from speaking about murder.
5,"Yeppp. The party of authoritarian power, corruption, and death. https://t.co/yodfuxItoo"
6,@vii_xxv_mmxix @trey_mccrae25 @DrJenLincoln Yep-men are required to do so &amp; I support that standard-it’s called child support payments. The idea that you must adopt in order to stand against murder is like saying you must financially support an ex-slave in order to be anti-slavery &amp; yes I publicly support adoption &amp; reform
7,"@katemccredie @natsechobbyist I see that Ukrainian flag in your bio.

So you support giving guns to civilians and self defense, as well. You just hide behind your ideology when it’s convenient.

Go get a haircut, man."

9,@herschelmiller7 they have been stopped. Now they must be memed
10,"@DrJenLincoln 1) What makes you think I am a man? You accuse my opinion of being disqualified based on my identity - can you define “man” and support that claim?

2) I didn’t say to calm down - by all means, go scream skyward. But don’t lie to peddle your products to scared young women 😂"

14,"@natsechobbyist Incorrect; there IS no right to kill someone else for convenience. There never was. 

Even the late RBG recognized Roe as bad law. The “right” you claimed was as fake as when people had the “right” to own other people based on skin color. Both were legal, but evil."
15,"@trey_mccrae25 @DrJenLincoln That makes no sense “fr”. 

You know how a human is made, right? An egg is joined to sperm… meaning your sperm is one half of what is required to make life.

This is like saying “A cake is every bit as much a baked good as a cup of flour is!” No… that not how it works."
16,"@DrJenLincoln Cite the constitutional reasoning for a right to abortion, please.

Even the late RBG said that Roe was bad law - it has no constitutional grounding whatsoever."
17,"@DrJenLincoln What an embarrassingly sensationalist tweet.

Birth control in pill, implant, &amp; physical form is not going away. You will always be allowed to go buy condoms for $1.99 at the gas station, now some states will simply have the right to stop you from killing a human for convenience."
