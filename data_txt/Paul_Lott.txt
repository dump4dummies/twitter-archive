0,@SenLouiseLucas You didn't read the article. She simple said how many she personally encountered and when asked a question by press said she had not read studies and didn't know.
1,@SenLouiseLucas I know you don't know this but most rapes occur from a known perpetrator who uses abortion to hide their crime (NIH).
2,@MarkWarner Stop being dishonest. They have the same rights they had last month because abortion was never a right and SCOTUS simply corrected a legal mistake.
3,@drkellyscriven Imagine posting on Twitter that a nonexistent right was rolled back by SCOTUS when all that happened was abortion was returned to the states and doctors will condemn anything that costs them money.

12,RT @jamesrwelchjr: In 1974 a 15 year old freshman found out she was pregnant. She was nervous and afraid. Some whispered to abort the child…
13,@jamesrwelchjr I love this

23,@MsChrisMason @RepWexton Wait. I thought you were a lawyer? Plessy? Brown overturned it? According to your understanding the law (Plessy) should still be in place legalizing segregation? After all precedent was violated to rid this nation of segregation. Did I get that right?
24,"@GavinWax Or…
Don’t have sex until you can handle the consequences. That list is really stupid. Before abortion existed no one asked for someone to pay them to hang around home for 5 months. We have become a society of snowflakes. Our grandparent had NONE of that and still built families."
25,@SenLouiseLucas You listen to those who exterminate your own people at record rates.
26,"@SenLouiseLucas That was Planned Parenthood, supported by the Democrats, who planned mass sterilization of Blacks long with mass Black abortion. They have done well. They have You, an outspoken Black leader, defending them as they kill more Black babies then are born in some states."
27,@lavern_spicer Lol
28,@rondeaulivia That is one of the most disturbing images I have ever seen.
29,@RonFilipkowski Well that was genius. Really? That's it?
30,@WinsomeSears Amen
31,"@PRandallcares @NetworkVirginia Notice on election day, there has not been a single Black person on TV saying they were prevented from voting. You only see politicians. We got the right back over 50 years. At this point its like bragging about being potty trained as a toddler."
32,@SenLouiseLucas I have a video of big foot attacking me...
33,@ananavarro @Twitter Oh so classy and lady like. I hope our daughters have other role models.
34,@MarkWarner And... the sky is falling...
35,@DoniTheDon_ @I__AmDunn Truth
36,@lifesafeast Lol. The French ban abortion after 14 weeks!!! And only allow it after if two doctors agree the woman's life is in danger. No exception for rape or incest. Not sure what they are shocked about.
37,@morethanmySLE Using the Biden rule.
38,@YaakovShlomo2 Please stay on strike.
39,@JDCocchiarella Nope. You obviously didn't watch the hearings.
40,@PRandallcares @BarackObama @JohnCornyn Thats not what that tweet was about. Plessy was overturned by Brown. He was challenging those defending the precedent of Roe as unchangeable against their support of Plessy being overturned. Plessy legalized segregation. Brown overturned it.
41,@VeithLaura Amen sister.
42,"@ananavarro They are not related issues. You seem to imply ""unless you fund zyx, we have to prevent people from being born"". You want choice, but you don't see that single motherhood is a choice. A bad one. You sound foolish."
43,"@PRandallcares The numbers before Row was 25 deaths from legal abortion and 39 deaths from illegal abortions. According to the NIH, more that 2000 women in California alone committed suicide within a year of a legal abortion. Tell me what that means."
44,@alfranken Why? Birth control and abortion are unrelated. Sick association…
45,@cpat3188 @hrkbenowen Lol. Don’t even know who to be mad at…
46,"@JenniferWexton Jen, you woke up! You say nothing about crime in schools, poverty, race-based education initiatives, but here you come over abortion. Please, Please Please go back to bed. We got this."
47,"@rachelgirwin Sick. In New York State, more blacks are aborted than born. You don see how abortion is racial oppression? One leftist study even liked Crime reduction to black abortions. Keep my race out of your abortion talk."
48,@rachelgirwin A proud legacy!!!
49,"@PRandallcares So what. If Dems do it now, Rub can do it later… It just solves nothing."

56,@mmpadellan Then when the next party is in power they just do it again. Duh
57,"@PRandallcares @ElizabethMomsVA @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand Gun safety is not the problem. Most guns in existence today were here before the gun violence. Gun ownership is lower than it was a generation ago, yet gun violence is higher. Explain that? Its the people. Not the guns."
58,@StephenKing Says the guy living in a state with the most liberal guns laws and the least violence.
59,@Kengriffey20 @RepDonBeyer Love it.
60,@PApynys @RepDonBeyer And the sky is falling…. Blah. Blah. Blah.
61,@RepDonBeyer No… The Supreme Court just stated that the government cannot take away a constitutional right without due process. It protects Americans from the Terran of the “marginal majority”. That is why we are a Republic and not a pure democracy. Your tweet is dangerous.

74,@CharlieCrist You are running against an imaginary governor since no such law exists? Wow
75,@PRandallcares You mean like dozens of Democrat members of congress did to the supreme court over Roe? So much that a would be assassin said it gave him purpose? I can't imagine. Like M Waters telling people to get in the face of Republicans and gather a mob? Wow. Tone deftness.
76,"@alexbruesewitz @YUNOHOO @AdamKinzinger @DanCrenshawTX Yeah, he is right. Focus on the fight."
77,@chairlzIII @ALGOP No
78,"@PramilaJayapal @POTUS No... SOME Americans would get relief because the government took money from the people who earn less who didn't go to college, or from people who paid their loans, to give it to people who will make more because of their degree. #unfair #CancelCancellingStudentLoans"
79,@lavern_spicer I would think she would need to pay me...
80,"Says the person who is part of cancel culture. I assume you are taking pride in being a ""witch"" burner? https://t.co/pRm6LIvkf0"
81,@Logically_JC So what… And I don’t want my money funding abortions. Do you care?

83,@PRandallcares Cannabis reduces the brain size of teens by 10% according to the NIH.
84,"@MarkWarner 

39 women died as a result of legal abortion. As many as 2000 die per year from suicide or reduced health due to depression. NIH"
85,"@MarkWarner 
Abortion kills: https://t.co/XebhJqV0tm"
86,@MarkWarner ProLife resources are real.  A woman who has an abortion is 154% more likely to commit suicide according to several NIH studies.
87,@OccupyDemocrats Kind of fake numbers. CA is the 5th largest economy and the center of US business. You have to look at comparative growth over time. Looking at real numbers Newson is wrong.
88,@MikeJLindell_ @elonmusk I am back too. Don’t forget me!
89,@StephenKing Silly tweet
90,"You are a public official. It is beneath the office to assign racism to this post. It is racist to call out your accusations of racism? That is a new one… Well, maybe not. Seems like you don’t think very deeply about your tweets. https://t.co/DJ9HC1YM4Q"
91,"@MichaelBeatrice You obviously live under a rock. The violence is coming from the left, not the right. The right is not shooting cops each week, attacking pro-life clinics by the dozens, canceling people because of social media posts, and supporting drug and human trafficking via open borders."
92,"@mom_needsalife No, Your child has a father. You two need to learn how to cooperate for the sake of the child."
93,@Logically_JC So? All of them!
94,@lyonizer @Logically_JC You obviously don't have kids. Teacher only think they are that important. Parent engagement has always been is the key to child success. Teachers play short term time limited roles.
95,@Logically_JC There are two many good parents being called bad parents because they don't agree with teacher.
96,@RepWexton Fake issue.
97,@EFillerCorn @GovernorVA Most was the tax holiday
98,@RBReich They were the ones bullying
99,@Elle373 @ACLUVA My insurance does pay. Benign is done to avoid future cancer. Abortion is not a fix for an illness. There is NO justification. None at all.
