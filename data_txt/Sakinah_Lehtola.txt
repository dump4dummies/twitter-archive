How do we move forward? How do we actually accomplish changing the current power structures?"
7,"I’m asking because within our frustration of how unbearable political circumstances have been, 

I see more criticism lately of the few Progressives we do have than of Republicans

And with this criticism rarely comes ideas or solutions, just

 “I would do better than they are”"

It is a FOR-PROFIT detention center for children. If Harris was against it when it was beneficial for her presidential bid, she should still be against it now."
28,"@Joan_of_Snarc @Martina @VP The reason I keep bringing up this event is because @VP came to this facility as a presidential candidate saying it was inhumane and a violation of human rights to hold children in such a place

Now she is literally working to REOPEN it.

Aren’t you sick of being played?"

42,"@Tristanshouts @Martina Did you know they could also bring back the Central American Minor refugee program dismantled by Trump? 

It helped kids come across and be United with family in the US and greatly reduced the number of kids coming alone

Instead their focus is... for-profit child jails"
43,"@Tristanshouts @Martina Do you not care that this has NOT been the case at the homestead detention center with reports of so much abuse that the VP herself came and demanded it be shut down? 

Not to mention that this is a PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT center causing them to hold children who even have sponsors"
44,"@Joan_of_Snarc @Martina @VP What I would like her to do is stick to her guns and not just political convenience.

During her campaign she came to this facility and demanded it be shut down, citing human rights violations

Now all of a sudden it’s ok because it’s her and Biden opening it instead of Trump?"
45,"@OnBakerStreet4 @Martina Foster homes, community based living facilities, temporary sponsors, 

Pretty much anywhere except an unsafe, private, FOR-PROFIT jail that already has a history of abuse and child neglect
