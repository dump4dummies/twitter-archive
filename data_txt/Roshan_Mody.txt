1,@AJentleson Ordered. Do you not think that them acting as though they won’t suffer electoral consequences is tied to their broad acceptance/support for overturning election results? That they are effectively operating as though they cant lose an election?

5,"@PGourevitch @JohnCassidy In what way has any state ever cared about the economics associated with its ideology? Their ideology and bigotry is more valuable to them than money. Moreover, a lot of these states had already effectively banned abortion (1 or 2 clinics left) without consequences."
6,@JoyAnnReid It is like we never learned anything from jim crow. Rights for some based on geography and agency just cannot be the answer to this crisis. And we are all to willing to live with bandaids and turn the page.
7,@mjmimages Michael. It is because I am bereft of hope. The revanchism is no longer furtive. It is brazen and nakedly open. Polity seem to be the appropriate choice over “fuck everyone and fuck this fucked up shit”
8,FYI: corporations are to the solution to or arbiters of our civil rights. Every time we ask them to be it reinforces their power as constituents of government and diminishes our own voice within our polity. https://t.co/BbpPsuqZgp
9,@katewillett I think we have found out on a raft of issues that solidarity doesn’t mean that they are willing to take action. It has not converted into plans or defense strategies. Solidarity is nothing to me anymore other than marketing and using a group’s agency for personal gain.

19,@joshtpm @ralphnf1 @HeerJeet @speechboy71 Take for instance the child tax credit. Pulling people out of poverty only to plunge them back in evaporated a 12 pt lead we had with those voters.
20,"@joshtpm @ralphnf1 @HeerJeet @speechboy71 What I want has nothing to do with this. It has to do with the relationship with dem voters, especially in red states. And as maps are tighter, turnout matters even more."
21,"@joshtpm @ralphnf1 @HeerJeet @speechboy71 Senators. Yes. House is shaking up to be a different story. Additionally, we will have self inflicted turnout problem. I am not saying enthusiasm could not change, but it certainly wont with the current relationship they party has with certain voting blocks."
22,@ralphnf1 @joshtpm @HeerJeet @speechboy71 We have a map problem. The math isn’t there for this.
23,@tressiemcphd As this continues they are going pivot focusing on quelling our dissent rather than looking inward. And I fear that will end in violence from our side. Yt people aren’t going to lose their rights peacefully.
24,@DavidOAtkins When the right is acting as though they are immune to electoral blowback it is the final sign that they have no intention counting our votes. They aren’t playing to win; they are playing as though they cant lose. I’m way beyond caring about judges and apptmts. Too late for that.
25,@Jennyil I just want to personally say that I am sorry for the loss of your rights. I did not intend to minimize that in any way. We have failed women. -R
26,RT @BlerdGirl1908: If my protest is acceptable to the oppressor it’s not protest.
27,@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes No. I believe all civil rights are important in that we should all have equal rights and be fully human. I am simply saying that laws that confer rights are not applied equally. And for many people those rights don’t exist at all.
28,@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes I did not argue that at all.
29,@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes ENFORCEMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE APPLICATION OF SODOMY LAWS
30,@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes I am just saying that even constitutional amendments that are seemingly absolute do not apply to all of us. It was upheld many decades later as a design flaw when conferring rights to women. Women in MT did not believe that this right they wrote for themselves should apply to us
31,"@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes I am not against women having rights in any way. That is not the argument here. What you are implying is that women’s rights come first. Please dont tell me that women’s rights confer to me when women have championed the fight against my rights, both historically and today."
32,"@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes This is a very white take and elides the fact that when you say women you mean white women. It has never been true for people of color, especially Black Americans."
33,"@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes I also cant not speak to your experience with gay men who would not vote for Hillary other than to say that we are no different than any other men. We can be bad, selfish, shitty people too."
34,"@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes It did not apply to gays in that those laws persisted for decades. Moreover, Sodomy laws aren’t about enforcement. They are about the pretext for discrimination and permission to be violent. They held that by default we were criminals &amp; could be rejected for jobs."
35,@Jennyil @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes Yes. In 1997. And still it faced opposition thereafter. They tried every workaround possible. My point is that those who benefited from this law certainly did not believe it should apply to gays.
36,"@myronjclifton @SBfut3 I am going to let your snideness go bc I don’t have the time today to rip you a new asshole, pal."
37,@childishquery @jmpalmieri @chrislhayes Sodomy laws aren’t about enforcement. They are about the pretext for discrimination and permission to be violent. It held that by default we were criminals &amp; could be rejected for jobs. Think of it like drug testing. It also reinforced that we were deviants &amp; not worth defending
38,@jmpalmieri @chrislhayes Fascinating how this absolute right to privacy did not extend to gays and afforded Montana to maintain sodomy laws. A few impt lessons here I guess

42,@joshtpm @HeerJeet @speechboy71 Totally agree
43,"@joshtpm @HeerJeet @speechboy71 Yes, but it gets to the point that we are likely never going to get to the ‘required’ power needed to overcome hurdles. We have to make the power we got now work for us. It is probably the most we will ever have given how we have let the structures tilt against us."
44,@mcopelov Agreed. We cannot accept that civil rights in America exist based on geography. We already fought a war about that.
45,@brhodes Even stranger is that people don’t understand Collins is the one pulling the con and we are the mark.
46,"@DavidOAtkins To me, that is not our problem. That is management’s problem. I know one thing: corrupt people are the easiest people to get your preferred outcome out of. That they cant break 2 people who are very open to the carrot and extremely susceptible to the stick is a management failure"
47,@NomeDaBarbarian Do you realize that these laws were often modified to explicitly apply to gays? And that it doesn’t matter how this shit is written. It matters only how it is applied. And that was to allow for discrimination against gays bc they were inherently criminal given these laws.

68,"@whstancil @ErikLoomis This has reminded me of a speech by Baldwin. At about 4 mins in he get to the point of why a group that is disillusioned with politicians may not be able to be reasoned with. The experience is obviously not comparable, but I think he answers your question: https://t.co/iI6y8fSQbp"
69,"This is all related to the right’s demand to overturn elections. While everyone is wondering why the right is acting with impunity, as though they wont invite a backlash with voters, it is clear that they can do so because they have decided any electoral backlash is illegitimate. https://t.co/Tw9hPP8M4c"

71,"@ErikLoomis @whstancil No progress for decades, only major losses or persistent systems of inequality that grew all consuming. Youth are the most impacted by this. And we all ran campaigns convincing them of this to engage them in voting. This was the chance to rectify some of that. &amp;they didn’t do it."
72,@ErikLoomis @whstancil I feel like the problem is extremely compounded by the long term inaction of democrats. They allowed nothing to happen for decades to arrest the growing problems and just permitted them to become so insanely big that everything is sort of a crisis or emergency.
73,"@whstancil @ErikLoomis A side note, I think broader enthusiasm for dem voters is being suppressed by loss of rights / extremism in red states. As states arrogate power to themselves, and dems simply refuse to wield power, the benefit of voting for dems at a federal level is diminished/ nonexistent."
74,@whstancil @ErikLoomis 3. Older voters wanted no change fundamentally. Their priority was normalization. And they are unaware of what we are sleepwalking into.
75,"@whstancil @ErikLoomis A few things:

90,"@drvolts I have always explained politics as a division between people who care about themselves and people who care about others, and an individual’s ideology is where they fall on that spectrum."
91,"@RonBrownstein When they paint a group as pedophiles, then you are giving society permission to use violence against them. Given that pedophiles  are considered worse than murderers, socially, they are making the argument that gays are monsters. That is how you get this guy at Pride in Idaho https://t.co/5pkMKv7wDp"
