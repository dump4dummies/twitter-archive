1,"Nancy, the majority of women in this country, and our district, are worried about their fundamental rights right now. And this is what you are talking about?

11,"NRA A-lister @NancyMace voted against the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act today. 

Nancy does not give a damn about our kids."
12,"Nancy is being dishonest, or she forgot who she represents. The governor of SC will outlaw abortion with no exceptions. This ruling has devastating consequences for the women of SC01.

22,"In parenting, I don’t always get it right. I buy them shoes that are uncomfortable, cook meals they don’t like, overreact, or underreact. 

But I admit when I am wrong.

Can @NancyMace admit she was wrong when she voted against the Jan 6th commission?"
23,@lizzy_lzrd Congratulations!!!

29,"I support legalizing cannabis. But unlike @NancyMace, I believe it should be legal, taxed, and regulated in all 50 states. Her proposal would do absolutely nothing for SC. But that’s what she always does. https://t.co/9cYiKUqqGW"

51,"In Congress, I will fight tirelessly for practical gun safety measures like universal background checks, red flag laws, and finally closing the Charleston loophole. I refuse to let another seven years go by without action to reduce gun violence. 3/3"
52,"We must also do so with action to stop tragedies like this before they happen. Because in the seven years since this senseless tragedy, little has changed. 
 
I am exhausted by performative statements from lawmakers who have the power to prevent tragedies like this. 2/3"
53,"Today, we remember the nine lives taken in a hate-fueled tragedy at Mother Emanuel AME Church seven years ago. We honor their legacy and turn our prayers towards the family members they left behind. But simply honoring their legacy with words is not enough. 1/3 https://t.co/I6lOTqdqDf"
