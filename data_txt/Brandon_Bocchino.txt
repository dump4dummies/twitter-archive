4,Love China Town. Friendship Arch looking great. https://t.co/zp1LM8kZYU
5,America is so fucking paranoid for no god damn reason. Must be profitable to be paranoid or else we wouldn‚Äôt do it.
6,I keep finding myself wanting to be the better person. Wanting to bridge the gap that‚Äôs formed in this nation. But the far right is squeezing this nation into submission. They want to see us bleed &amp; we have to stay strong in the face of this violent aggression.
7,"The devil hasn‚Äôt had to come to work in decades thanks to the @GOP doing his work for him. I know y‚Äôall have to kill America &amp; decimate our society cause Republicans are miserable and misery enjoys company, but please just stay home and let the grown ups fix America today please."
8,Washington DC this morning. Just walked into my hotel room. 5 hours of sleep then it‚Äôs back on the road to North Carolina.

11,I love New Hampshire. Beautiful state in a beautiful nation. God bless.
12,@TacoHockey50 You sound sacred ‚ùÑÔ∏è
13,"This nation will be unrecognizable if we don‚Äôt show up this November to vote. Vote Blue. Vote Democrat. Vote for democracy, freedom, the constitution &amp; the future rights of your children. Republicans want to control you. Democrats want democracy. #RoeVsWade #USA"
14,America doesn‚Äôt feel more Christian today with Roe v Wade overturned. It feels more dangerous and unrecognizable as the democracy I was born into. This is a disgusting assault against women by extremist in this nation. Damn the Republican Party &amp; damn Donald Trump.
15,"Yep. Turned out pretty fucking sick. üî• Dix Hills, New York. Just arrived in Manchester, New Hampshire heading up to Maine. #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/zJ86Xjk7vD"

17,Living the dream. Heading out to New York City today. Have a smooth Wednesday everyone. Hope it‚Äôs a good one. #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/bKlMu4SjL6
18,Have a great day everyone. Love your neighbors. Support the troops. &amp; put Donald Trump in jail for his role in the direct assault on our democracy. The responsible thing is to hold him &amp; all his enablers accountable. #USA #Jan6thCommitteeHearings
19,I‚Äôve noticed a lot more gas stations out of premium gas lately.
20,Prosecute Trump for Jan. 6th. The evidence is apparent &amp; abundant. #January6thHearings
21,üòÇ why did this person think that was an insult? https://t.co/nFBObH3JYt

23,Too much fun. I only buy #NFTs to collect so when I heard @jaredpolis had created his first I needed to add that to my collection. Much love Polis ü§ô Thanks for being an amazing governor &amp; human being. #Colorado #NFTCommunity #cryptocurrency #USA https://t.co/RvxVAmORFs
24,Greatest feeling ever watching your work get admired. Til next time Colorado. About to leave for Wisconsin to work on the next Corvette. https://t.co/VEQvg3k1Xd
25,I was hearing music for hours last night in my hotel room &amp; figured it was next door. I leave my room to go knock (it‚Äôs 2am at this point) &amp; it‚Äôs not my neighbors room‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 3 doors down and management was already trying to enter the room. Old man fell asleep with his tv on ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26,Made it out to Moab for coffee this morning then into Colorado. Of course we stopped by Colorado National Monument. Lakewood for work the next few days then Wisconsin. #bokeynomotorsports #Colorado #ColoradoNationalMonument https://t.co/56VScT1OIc
27,Camped out at Newspaper Rock last night. Beautiful moon. Grabbing coffee in Moab at my usual place. #Utah #NewspaperRock https://t.co/Ejnm7K8yHK
28,Excited for this next season of Texas Tech football. Absolutely going to a home game or two &amp; probably even a road game into hostile territory. Have to support Red Raider nation. #TexasTech #RedRaiders
29,"Page, Arizona today. Lake Powell &amp; Antelope Canyon. Then Monument Valley. Desert fun time."
30,Epic night ending with a cave concert. Southern Utah at its finest. #MoquiCave #Utah #travel #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/XRgwPHkVCp
31,"Took some brilliant pictures of the bighorn sheep as they started to bolt in the canyon. Zion National Park, Utah. Beautiful day. #bighornsheep #bighorn #Utah #ZionNationalPark #beautiful #canyon #nature #wildlifephotography https://t.co/vQTxQIjHhA"
32,Cave concert. Southern Utah. #Utah #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/1gyv3AzMWo
33,"All of clients, business partners, friends, family.. everyone I know basically in my immediate life orbit are hardcore conservatives. We completely disagree on literally everything. But they love my work ethic &amp; that seems to be enough for them to overlook the politics."
34,"Last few days I‚Äôve bounced around between Oregon, California &amp; Nevada. Currently in Las Vegas about to pack up &amp; head out to Zion National Park. #LasVegas #travel https://t.co/10LG2qfQSt"
35,"Park City, Utah has been wonderful. Great time working on a great ride. Technically working in Salt Lake City, but I‚Äôm blessed to be able to choose my morning commute everyday in a different city. #Utah #Corvette https://t.co/mJtS7UALQI"
36,You‚Äôll never find a bigger Ukraine hawk. We are so far behind the ball &amp; we can‚Äôt catch up at this point. They needed missiles that could hit Moscow. We should start bolstering Poland‚Äôs military. We need everyone ready for the worst case scenario because Putin will trigger it.
37,Good to be in Utah. #ParkCity #Utah https://t.co/PpSEKvmW7A
38,"Camped out at Four Corners last night. Beautiful night sky. Spent the night before that camped out at Great Sand Dunes stargazing. At the resort in Park City, Utah for the evening. #Colorado #NewMexico #Utah #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/QLjQhZGVU1"
39,Good visit in Lubbock. Love my #RedRaider family. #KeepLubbockFlat
40,"The #Texas Dept. Of Public Safety has universally degraded the public perception of police across the nation. 

Police lying about a school shooting, the timeline, &amp; their response.. pretending to be heroes while they sat back and allowed children to be massacred is disgusting."
41,"En route to Roswell, New Mexico. 

Of course I‚Äôm stopping in Lubbock to see my old Red Raider colleagues that still call West Texas home."
42,Beautiful day in north Texas.
43,"@POTUS I am extremely thankful that you are the President. Even with all of the vile hate filled lies the @GOP hurls at you, you still reach across the aisle for bipartisan compromise. Incredible strength from an incredible leader. #USA #Biden"
44,Give #Ukraine cruise missiles. Give them weapons capable of knocking Russia back to the Stone Age. Missiles that can hit Moscow. This is it. We can not depend on the Russian people to come to their senses and take Putin out. We have to make Russia bleed before a nuclear exchange.
45,"Happy Memorial Day. Honoring those who gave their lives defending our nation, neighbors &amp; democracy. 

Also taking time to honor the hundreds of dead children killed by school shootings in our nation. Our soldiers didn‚Äôt sacrifice their lives just so we can debate saving children"
46,3 days. 3 Corvette C8‚Äôs https://t.co/TntT3uXNdd
47,"@smerconish give a mouse a cookie‚Ä¶ 

give Putin some land &amp; he‚Äôll just want more and more and more. Putin‚Äôs thirst is unquenchable. His investment in hypersonic tech &amp; nuclear capability at the expense of the Russian people is because of intent. Intent to use."
48,I just realized the reporter from Sky News grilling Senator Cruz over school shootings ate dinner next to me 2 nights ago in San Antonio. I know because we spoke briefly about Norwich (where he went to college &amp; where my father is from). Recognized his face &amp; accent. Small world.
49,@LeaderMcConnell I know you pride yourself on being the ‚Äúgrim reaper‚Äù of Congress. Did you ever think you‚Äôd be known as the grim reaper of children? To me that‚Äôs what you are. You block any progress on gun reform and safety. You‚Äôve supported 2 decades of school shootings. Inhuman
50,"RT @BetoORourke: Alithia was killed yesterday.

Her parents welcomed me into their home today. Balloons from Alithia‚Äôs 10th birthday were s‚Ä¶"
51,"RT @POTUS: I just signed an Executive Order that delivers the most significant police reform in decades. It will increase accountability, b‚Ä¶"
52,"Brownsville, Texas the next few days."
53,"Everyone keeps telling me how easy it is to buy assault weapons off the black market. Have you tried??

It‚Äôs a breeze walking into a store &amp; buying a gun then surfing the dark web for a dealer to go meet. A friend of mine was killed/robbed trying to buy a black market gun."
54,I work with police everyday. A large portion of my clients are police. They are all telling me the police in Uvalde are lying &amp; they are sick to their stomach watching how horribly they‚Äôve handled this situation. This is fucked. We trust them to protect us &amp; they refuse and lie.
55,If my child was in a school where a shooting was taking place &amp; an officer refused to engage and even tried to hold me back from getting in I‚Äôm breaking that officers face in. I would do whatever it takes to save my child. Police obviously will not. Chicken shit police in Uvalde
56,School resource officers are a billion dollar boondoggle. The gunman planning to shoot up my high school ten years ago didn‚Äôt care we had 3 armed officers in our school everyday. Didn‚Äôt help the students at Parkland. Didn‚Äôt save the kids in Uvalde.
57,"@GovAbbott you are a plague &amp; as Texans we deserved this plague. We refuse to take to the streets and protect our kids from Abbott. We refused to protect our state parks, clean water, robust schools, and kind communities from you. We let you ruin this state &amp; we deserve the pain."
58,"San Antonio over the next few days. 

Enjoyed the riverwalk &amp; revisited the Alamo. #Texas #SanAntonio #Alamo https://t.co/sJzoBjOsJl"
59,"The battle cry of our Texan ancestors was ‚ÄúRemember the Alamo‚Äù

The battle cry for the present generation of Texans should be ‚ÄúRemember Robb Elementary‚Äù

We have to stop the chaos. #Texas #Ulvade"
60,"As a nation we are failing our children &amp; the next generation. 

We allow the wicked and hateful to slaughter our children in our schools. We allow terrorist access to firearms so they can kill our kids. The outdated 2nd amendment even helps protect these terrorist. We are fucked"
61,Every time I visit my home state of Texas I find myself mourning the mass death of children in this state. This is not the #Texas I grew up in. The Texas I grew up in took care of it‚Äôs citizens. The Texas I grew up in got mad &amp; took action when it‚Äôs citizens were under attack.
62,Biden just keeps earning brownie points in my book. Keeping America committed to Taiwan &amp; saying what he said is exactly what I would‚Äôve done.
63,"Branson, Missouri tonight. Springfield, Missouri tomorrow."
64,Security. Together. https://t.co/hC4AMcPEXt
65,"It‚Äôs still not enough. I agree it is also unsustainable, but by the time we cross that bridge I suspect the conflict will have dragged more nations in &amp; WW3 will be closer to fully breaking out. At that point it won‚Äôt matter how much we spent. https://t.co/kSBktwNaSZ"
66,When I first watched this video by the US Army 4th PSYOP it instantly reminded me of a series of videos I watched out of Russia around 2012 made by the GRU. Incredible the sense of melancholy this video can invoke but also has this energy. https://t.co/OZIeYqvSk9
67,Beautiful game. Extraordinary season. Still wearing my @DallasStars gear this morning. #DallasStars #DallasPride https://t.co/c2ZfgP6UFK
68,"We need to pass additional spending on #Ukraine immediately. #Putin is not stopping. 

We need to give Ukraine everything possible to defend itself from being scorched off the planet by Russian bombs. This is good vs evil. #Russia is blatantly committing genocide."
69,@LucyMcBath Became a fan of Congresswoman McBath two years ago hearing hear speak out on gun violence. Happy to support her again before the primary. #Georgia #Democrats  https://t.co/If58L98Naw
70,"I was showing my friend a video clip from Russian state tv over 10 years ago &amp; he chided that their rhetoric sounded familiar.

Sounds like Trump supporters."
71,Wow! What a start! Let‚Äôs go @FCDallas ‚öΩÔ∏è one goal after the other

Definitely coming back out next home game. #IndianaFever #Indianapolis https://t.co/R6jZx7xvDK"
75,"Walked by Darius Leonard at halftime of the @IndianaFever game. Thanks for letting me say hi, shake your hand &amp; get a picture. As a @Colts &amp; all things Indiana fan that was an incredible experience. Wish I was wearing my Leonard jersey! #Colts #Indianapolis #Indiana #NFL #WNBA https://t.co/uqfvXWBxGZ"
76,Court side for the Fever game tonight! #FeverGameNight https://t.co/4mUlAvJxRw
77,"Defend our rights. Defend democracy. Strengthen education. Vote Blue. 

New districting has united Cincinnati (gerrymandering split it in 2 last decade) &amp; gives Dems a great chance at taking this seat back from Republicans. #Ohio #Congress @actblue https://t.co/wxNPlkX5pI"
78,I just made a donation to  @CaptMarkKelly 's campaign for Senate. #FullSpeedAhead https://t.co/LCSAlPOIrl
79,@POTUS should travel to Kyiv on Victory Day. Send the most direct message to Moscow yet. We are not afraid. We are not going anywhere. #Ukraine is our friend. They are our brothers &amp; sisters in democracy. We must stop Russia‚Äôs genocide against Ukraine &amp; any future wars of Putin‚Äôs
80,Says the man who bullied woman with sexually explicit remarks &amp; lied through his confirmation process to be on the Supreme Court. Justice Thomas.. you‚Äôre kind of a loser. Definitely a liar. Most certainly not fit to be on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/zViBwbhNdi
81,"There is no line we should be afraid to cross when defending Ukraine &amp; democracy loving people around the world from the tyranny and barbarism of Putin‚Äôs Russia

There are still good people in Russia. Democracy loving people. We have to reach them. We need their help."
82,Michigan today for work. Just took the ferry over from Milwaukee. https://t.co/pisAm6jNPm
83,"Currently sitting on a rooftop downtown Eau Claire, Wisconsin looking over the city lights. 

Beautiful. Nights like these I wonder.. I knew as I child I wanted to travel &amp; see every town, city and park in this country in a way no one else had before. 

Would little me be proud?"
84,"Consequences for McCarthy‚Äôs Trump comments? Probably not.

JD Vance once called Trump ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Hitler‚Äù but Trump still endorsed him in Ohio‚Äôs primary.

Why? JD Vance &amp; McCarthy although once had a bark, never had any bite &amp; quickly folded into the perfect lap dogs for Trump."
85,"@Luisrodolfocab4 I‚Äôd feel sorry for you, but you need a soul and human heart first. Your lies are your own key to your own cell in hell.

Is it worth it? You‚Äôre giving everything away.. your mind, your body, your life.. Putin is your pimp &amp; your just another one of his prostitutes."
86,"Why didn‚Äôt a Supreme Court made up of David Souter, Anthony Kennedy, &amp; Sandra Day O‚Äô Connor make abortion illegal?

Because it‚Äôs legal precedent &amp; political suicide."
87,Putin plans on trotting out 500 Ukrainian prisoners of war during the Victory Day parade beaten &amp; demoralized to strike fear into those who oppose him. https://t.co/Hopd9n5GTa
88,"I am weeping for everyone in Azovstal &amp; Mariupol. 

This war will end with either Putin‚Äôs death or a nuclear holocaust. 

My entire Congressional campaign was about preventing this damn war. I know I know nothing of America‚Äôs domestic woes. But foreign policy is in my blood."
89,"Watching the Moldovan ambassador on CNN &amp; looking back through my campaign notes from 2018. I‚Äôm never the one to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù does no good. Let‚Äôs just find a solution now. 
But I did say in 2018 &amp; had it on my website that we needed to reach out to Transnistria before war"
90,"#NATO did not start this war. 

A pathetic ethno nationalist that turned his own nation into his personal piggy bank started this war. 

The Russian people fell for Putin‚Äôs absurdities making them susceptible &amp; able to carry out his atrocities. Putin‚Äôs lies have killed thousands."
91,Picked up my Corvette today. 81‚Äô C3. Beautiful. This is going to be fun üòà #corvette #corvettec3 #bokeynomotorsports https://t.co/wLzVypQPTo
92,Give #Ukraine everything we‚Äôve got to hold back Putin‚Äôs plans for Europe. Putin will put this world in an early grave. He‚Äôs an ethno-nationalist with nuclear weapons.
93,"The time has come to elect someone new to represent #Indiana in the Senate. I‚Äôm backing McDermott. üá∫üá∏

Pick up my 81‚Äô Red Corvette on Monday. https://t.co/VMZyPzGYKt"
95,Recession? No. Just a realignment. Straddle the bumps. Ride the waves. It‚Äôll be okay.
96,Think I just might cash in my #crypto tomorrow &amp; buy a Corvette. An old C3 to fix up &amp; work on when I‚Äôm home.
97,Finally made some company t-shirts https://t.co/cGncCdRkv4
98,"If I was President I would‚Äôve already visited Kyiv. I would‚Äôve already had US troops on the ground. 

We are already at war with Russia. We have been since before I was in high school. Cyber attacks, economic actions, political pressures and proxy wars. The fire grows nuclear."
