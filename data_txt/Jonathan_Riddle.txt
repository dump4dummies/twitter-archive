29,Amazing the historical peace deals to Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the democrats and their media view it as a distraction and no coverage whatsoever. The Trump administration is doing things no president has had the courage to do! Isreal is vital to our national security!
30,"@jahimes Wow I knew you disliked America and it's history, now I really know you hate America. Many citizens, especially our youth wouldn't be able to pass the citizens exam because of the piss poor education standards This is an incredible step. I can't wait to end your political career!"
31,"@ChrisMurphyCT Additionally, there is no vaccine and the media were perpetuating lies that hydroxychloroquine wasn't effective when it saved lies and you ridiculed Trump for touting its benefits. Why don't you talk about Lamont's Tyrannical rules and extensions of powers not warranted!!"
32,@ChrisMurphyCT You are incompetent to be our Senator in CT. Let's be honest for a second or is that too hard for you? No one could have prevented any deaths nor the spread no matter what you did. But you all on the left called Trump xenophobic for the travel ban and went about your business
33,"@ChrisMurphyCT Sen. Murphy, you and @jahimes are the reason why CT has fallen so far. Neither of you have delivered for Connecticut and your ideas at best are ludicrous, destructive, and idiotic. You and Himes need to resign effectively immediately. Go home, to DC since you don't live in CT!"
34,"Great to see so many patriots showing up at the Stamford Back the Blue rally, to support our finest. Those men and women who run towards danger as we flee for safety. News 12 reported 50 people showed up, I'll let the video speak for itself. https://t.co/eyXQkKFHgy"

39,"Children are the least vulnerable to COVID-19 (Professor Peter Collignon, an Australian microbiologist and infectious disease physician, writes in the Guardian). Closing schools will hurt children more than protect them from the COVID-19."
40,This is especially true for Autistic and learning disable students which is causing LIFETIME DAMAGE which many students will not recover from. Democrats are demonstrating grotesque indifference towards students in our inner cities who suffer the most from delayed reopening.
41,"Despite recommendations from prominent pediatricians across our nation  advocating for school reopening this fall, Democrats continue to advocate for the erosion of quality education for all students who deserve the benefits of in-person classes instruction."
42,The national discourse lately regarding school reopening across the nation and in the 4th Congressional district here in Connecticut is truly disheartening. While the majority of nations in Europe and Asia have opened their schools full time we are the outlier here.
