26,@pit5000 Absolutely! Not implying the media created any of these situations. But how they pick and choose what to cover is extremely manipulative. I can think of at least 10 problems that have existed for years and effect our everyday lives that never get this level of attention.

42,@LSPmatt @lsptex @JasmineForUS Funny how no one talked about crypto in the 30th until independent people made an in-kind donation. Even though crypto/blockchain is a very real part of the future of finance. Will you give that same energy to the THOUSANDS raised by @JaneHopeTX to FORCE @RepEBJ out her seat?👀
