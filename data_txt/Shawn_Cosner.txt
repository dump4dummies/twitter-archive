1,@BBCJonSopel These are strange times indeed. The worst of humanity has shown itself as the rule not the exception once again. But what follows is growth and a commitment to protect the peace for a few generations. Our People will fight for decency.I enjoyed your piece and wish you the best.
2,@ianxian @donwinslow @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorSinema What Candidate in the State of West Virginia would you offer who would recieve enough votes to ensure party line legislation voting? It's not an issue of hardball but the likelyhood his replacement will be a Republican decreasing the odds of any compromise. Manchin is neutral.
3,@shelnino @donwinslow @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorSinema Not sure I understand. Should I apologize to you for something?
4,"@ahmadihamed_ That and the bread placed out of frame, is a sustainable amount of food. Fruit and meat are luxuries in the place you just left where 13 of our Marines died. Being a writer you know perceptions and context are important.

5,"@donwinslow @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorSinema How has the legislative process become so offensive? America has truly lost a piece of understanding that may never return for generations. So called ""Americans"" are destroying peace for partisanship..."

12,"Expanding the Court is not the solution.  Why would a person speak of expanding the Court to favor one side over the other.  Statements like this are why we are dealing with  divisiveness in America.  As a leader, that is reckless and irresponsible. You can do better. @AOC"
13,"I do not see many solutions on the ballot. When new leaders are elected our issues do not disappear. 
The same choices continue to yield the same results. We can do better. We the People deserve better.  We must Defend America Values"
