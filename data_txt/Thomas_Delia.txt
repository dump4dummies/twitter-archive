25,"@EccentricSean @marcorubio @SenRickScott @SMurphyCongress @salado4congress One of the first platforms I hammered down was the legalization of marijuana, as 2/3rds of the country supports it.

You got Orlando enough money to build at best 8 apartments, not buildings, total units. Orange and Seminole counties arent any better. Hey, toot that horn though."
