1,"@NateDawg2022 Nate: Unfortunately, I did not make it onto the Special Election ballot. I'm still a candidate, just in case something else unexpected happens again. Meanwhile, I'm endorsing Mary Peltola for the Special and General elections for Alaska's U.S. House of Representatives seat :-)}"
2,"@Alascat907 @ReturningA @NBegich It's June 26th. Please note that I've endorsed Mary Peltola, who shares many of my progressive views, for the Special and General elections for the U.S. House of Representatives (AK). Thanks :-)}"
3,"TO MY SUPPORTERS: THANK YOU! 
Numerous candidates ran, a ton of votes were cast, my $258 campaign did extraordinarily well, your support/vote sent a powerful message to the hefty PACs, out-of-staters, special interest groups, that it's no longer business as usual. Thank you :-)} https://t.co/3eddAeiJuE"
4,"@TyWalter8271 Ty: Please note that I've been a candidate ONLY in the Special Election, because I think it's unlikely that any candidate can do that and simultaneously campaign and fundraise for the general election. I am 75 and have no interest in spending 2-years in Congress. Thanks :-)}"
5,"@BeingTomJohnson As far as I can tell, there is no provision for any write-in candidates in this Special Election. Thanks :-)}"

11,"@Mtngoater Hi, Max: No. There is no provision for any write-in candidates in the Special Election. Thanks :-)}"
12,"@gremloe Hi: It seems that, if Tara (or anyone else) decides to challenge/sue Alaska's Division of Elections and wins, Tara would become #4 on the ballot, not I. Unless another candidate files an official withdrawal before certification on 6-25, that situation won't change. Frustrating."
13,"ELECTION UPDATE (6-23)
It's likely that Alaska's Division of Elections will include only three candidates on our Special Election ballot. If true on 6-25, I'll Tweet you my heartfelt THANK YOU video and invite you to vote for Mary Peltola, who shares many of my progressive views. https://t.co/VpZDeYbZvK"
14,"@scooterkendall @JamesRuffin88 Scott: Thanks for the clarification. I'm not sure that my supporters know you are the attorney I referred to in my Tweet. As an early supporter of (and voter for) Ranked Choice Voting in Alaska, I appreciate the hard work you put into drafting the RCV legislation we have now :-)} https://t.co/jPGHQuSmA8"
15,"@JoeJuneau2 @lruskin @scooterkendall @AKpublicnews True. At 75 years-old, I do not want to spend my next 2 years in Congress. Had voters been able to elect me in the Special Election, it would have been much easier for Mary to campaign and fundraise for Nov, without having to catch up, stay current, and legislate in Sept/Oct :-)}"
16,"@scooterkendall Scott: I Tweeted that Sweeney had CONCEDED, not withdrawn. Thanks :-)}"
17,"@UrsaBorealis UB: I'm an independent, progressive, democratic socialist. A Repub blocked the chance for any other candidate to be #4 on our Special Election ballot. If the Division of Elections certifies the election on 6/25, and there are no more surprises, I will support Mary Peltola :-)}"

19,@puzzleheadpopup @Axiom_Space @NASA @NASA_Astronauts @SpaceX Thank you :-)}
20,"@ineptninja90 Sarah: Yes, conceding gracefully is respectful. The Special Election candidates who withdrew or conceded alluded to the new RCV system making things difficult for them (and donors). One didn't even try to fight for the fourth Special Election seat. That's disrespectful to voters."
21,"@Desmoniouss Desmond: Thanks, but there's no provision for voters to cast their ballot for any write-in candidates in the Special Election."
22,"@JoshForNY Joshua: The way it stands now is that I do not have a chance to ballot, nor does anyone else. One candidate withdrew, another conceded, but did not withdraw. Should a candidate contest and prevail over the Div. of Elections, only Tara would benefit, not I. Sad but true."
23,"@JoshForNY Joshua: If I were to go to court and win, that only benefits Tara. She conceded and didn't withdraw. It would not benefit me. She would just take the #4 spot for herself, without having fought for it in court, and still would criticize the Alaska's new RCV system."
24,"@IrishDramaQueen @GOP It appears as though Tara is blocking anyone, including herself, from occupying #4 on the special election ballot. So, I'll be taking her to task, while addressing the reality of the situation. Time to redirect my energy, to help steer this election in a productive direction :-)}"
25,"@ZannLittleAK @InUnpaid Suzanne: Whomever goes to DC in Sept, has to finish Don's office stuff, stay current, and campaign and fundraise for the 2-year term. That's an Rx for failure, just before the Nov vote. Anyway, Tara is precluding anyone from taking the #4 spot. I'm taking her to task; Mary can't."
