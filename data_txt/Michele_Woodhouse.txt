45,"@MoonshinerWNC @chriscooperwcu And then there is election integrity. Chuck co-chairs another FAILURE! Ask GOP leadership that showed him evidence of ballot harvesting in Buncombe.

46,@MoonshinerWNC @chriscooperwcu And then there is the redistricting disaster. Chuck served on this committee - he loves a committee - and they handed 2 Congressional seats to Pelosi.
47,@MoonshinerWNC @chriscooperwcu And then SB232 which Chuck voted for that gave Cooper open season on mask mandates. If he can‚Äôt have forethought on Jones St - he won‚Äôt have it in DC. He has taken a knee to the Dems for years.
48,@MoonshinerWNC @chriscooperwcu And don‚Äôt forgot SB476 when Chuck voted to put SEL/CRT into our classrooms. This bill opened the door for this disaster we have placed upon on children. Not ‚Äúword salad‚Äù just FACTS.
49,@WesternPolitics The founder of this PAC was Biden‚Äôs 2020 #2 donor! Why is he giving to Chuck?? $30m in the infrastructure bill that Tillis voted for. FOLLOW THE MONEY! This is the pro-amnesty left trying to buy this seat!

51,@chriscooperwcu Those mailers are courtesy of Thom Tillis. Spent over $600k trying to buy the seat for Chuck. We can‚Äôt drain the swamp if we just change the water.
