10,@Lisa_Asillie @realRobertCByrd @kaylayoungforwv I think it is respectful to call one darlin. Never had a complaint.  Smiling is a great non verbal means of communication.  Maybe not modern in your world. Gentlemanly in mine.

12,@Lisa_Asillie @realRobertCByrd @kaylayoungforwv WE???? or one individual. Facts are important things.
13,@kaylayoungforwv It appears you are criticizing prior to seeing the product to be criticized.   I don't think one has to be in WV to comment on redistricting when the majority is in charge.
14,@pushkinforhouse @kaylayoungforwv Southern term of endearment.  Probably call you hoss or chief.  No personal insults here. Simple discussion.
15,"@kaylayoungforwv Darlin, Yall are in the vast minority now and you drew the lines. (without complaining about it)  I would like to think the districts will be put together according to code to serve West Virginians rather then the 2010 model."

24,@SusanMileyWV Maybe you haven't? I have run my own businesses and those of others since the 80's. Thanks for a veiled insult rather than conversation between intellegent adults.  I will end here.

28,"@SusanMileyWV You asked, I answered. It was not a condition of employment.  There are other diseases, that are contagious. If vacination wasn't important for communicable disease then why now?  I would think other employees can protect themselves if they wish thus should not be an issue."
29,@SusanMileyWV Not a snarky question.  If the vac was a condition of employment prior to being employed then I follow.  Afterward it is a change of the premise upon which one was hired.

39,"@WVUFLU Seems you would recognize one that follows the rule you voted for but much like your criticism of Governor, your commentary is self serving rather than real.  Also, ones medical information is personal. I am not embarrased or proud of a medical treatment. It is simply a decision."

85,"@ladyvolhoops @BeachForWV I'm a conservative.  Sure you ""systemically""attempt to oppress me. I don't disrespect my country to make that point."
