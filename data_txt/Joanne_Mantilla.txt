2,"2) covering health expenses for everyone in the U.S. - NOW - in the middle of a pandemic - is the time. 

Because if we don't....people are going to die."
3,"1) When I finally have time to breathe between shifts at work...unemployement is on the rise, health insurance, for many, is tied to unemployment. How will we maintain continuity of care? If there was ever a moment for the federal government to step-in and take the reigns on"

To that end-Right now we also need #CovTraining so to ensure there‚Äôs enough #CovStaff. Folx must rem‚Ä¶"
13,"The last thing we want is fear of seeking treatment due to being un- or under-insured. Could the federal government cover the cost of anyone treated and/or admitted for COVID19? And not just require private insurers to pay? 

https://t.co/FqkAG4Rdfn"
14,"@jongeeting I wonder if we could subdivide aid-areas along the 'Buy Nothing' maps? Would make it more local and easier to access! Also, a smaller group is easier to manage and integrate across platforms?"
15,@JAMJAR_SSB64 I'm building up your immune system. You're fine.
16,"@victoriadams !!!!!!! thank you for the shout-out and for reading those long Reddit replies üòÇ. 2020, 2222, 2224, I'll be running each year until I get to the House!"
17,"10) and for goodness sake...DO NOT prioritize big businesses or the stock market over people's lives and ability to live ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

Because literally....what else is your job but to take care of your people?"
18,"9) I am willing to put my life and family at risk but do not - DO NOT - leave us unsupported anymore. Unleash the funding. Give to service, hourly, retail workers financial aid (UBI anyone?) and also to anyone who doesn't have the privilege of being at home for two weeks."
19,8) but all of that - ALL - pales in comparison to how I feel right now - left without decisive action and leadership from the very gov't that is supposed to protect me while I'm doing my job. That legit DOWNPLAYED a pandemic when all the data and science said üò±üò±üò±..
20,7) Goodness knows what kind of germs I've brought home or been exposed to (I will definitely be in an isolation room when I'm old....)
21,"6) I've been physically and verbally threatened at work. I've held hands of the dying, fended off rude, mean, angry family members. Kept my mouth shut through racist and/or xenophobic comments."
22,"5) I knew what I signed up for as a nurse. I know what it means to be essential personnel. To work weekends and holidays. I've driven to work through absolute blizzards, floods, hurricanes - everything except a tornado or earthquake."
23,"4) also, WHO DO YOU EXPECT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE WHEN YOUR HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE IS SICK üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ #essentialpersonnel"
24,"3) CDC - why is it that an entire basketball team can get tested ASAP, while I - yes, this is personal - have to wait, beg, borrow, show symptoms, sell a potential kidney to get tested if I'm afraid of being exposed @ work?"
25,"2) My thoughts so far. 

Aight. Let's send everyone a mail-in ballot for upcoming primary elections. 

And stop mortgage, rent, interest, student loan payments and late fees."
26,"1) Feeling extra sassy tonight. I've intentionally tried to keep my campaign social medias thought provoking, hopeful and insightful, but week one into this COVID19 situation has me ü§¨ ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨. 

Campaign on pause while I focus on staying healthy to report to work @ the hospital."
27,"To the gov't, CDC, powers that be: 

In the spirit of Khaleesi, 'WHERE ARE MY SUPPLIES. WHERE ARE MY TESTS.'

32,"(9) But, I will not give up. We will not give up. I will not and cannot abandon the people on the streets of my neighborhood who have shared their stories with me. More than anything, I want to raise awareness about the issues I've learned about."
33,"(8) Now on to the process of restructuring the campaign timeline til November. More organizing, recruiting, and fundraising! (And Lord knows how terrible I am at asking people for money ü§™)"
34,"(7) So for now, the work continues. I am still out and about trying to learn first hand the experiences of people who live in this district. I've started in Kensington, where I live. I cannot stop campaigning now, too many people are dying pbysically, emotionally, and mentally."
35,"(6) If you have more questions, I will have a follow-up video soon to talk about out original plan to run on the Democratic ballot and what happened, why we are reorienting our direction and what to expect from here."
36,"(5) I know leadership is a constant pursuit of growth, and sometimes its painful. Sometimes, you feel that the rug has been completely pulled out from under you. And that's 1000% how I felt the past two weeks. Learning to trust my instincts and own my decisions is my focus now."
37,"(4) New nurse? Ask an experienced one! New mom? Ask someone who's a mom! Running for Congress? Ask - lol wait....I don't have that many people in my phone book running for Congress. But nursing 101 - always have a plan B if plan A fails, and plan A failed üòÇ."
38,"(3) I will not be on the Democratic Primary Ballot in April. 

But I am not giving up. After the Reddit AMA, I took some time to reorient myself and the campaign. This is the first journey I've been on where I have questions no one can really answer but myself."
39,"(2) I'm happy to fill you in on where I've been the past two weeks. 

I started off campaigning to be on the Democratic Primary Ballot in April. We completed our petitions, submitted them, but in a weird (and very emotional on my part, not gonna lie) twist of events,"
40,"(1) TL;DR - I will be running as an independent in the general election in November!

46,Ah! Adding the missing context for my thoughts: my response to the idea that immigrants take more than they contribute to the U.S.
47,"And yes, I support a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented and documented immigrants.

Also, I need to do more research to understand the US's complicated history of quotas..."
48,"(3) If we all had access to free health care, education, and affordable housing - how would the dynamic change?"
49,"(2) What I hear: People are angry because they don't have the basic social support systems to survive. A very real perspective rooted in fear, anger, and mistrust."
50,"(1) Reading debates about immigration on Twitter - holy guacamole. 

Big debate over whether or not people 'deserve' to be here, whether they came here 'the right way'."
51,"(5) But following my own advice and taking a much needed break from campaigning today üò¨. 

Campaigning is more than a fulltime endeavor. It's all consuming. When you're not working on it, you're still think about it. And there's a constant question of, 'did I do enough?'"
52,"(4) I don't want bandaid solutions. I want real, sustainable policy solutions. And I'm not about blanket statements with no roadmap on how to get there."
53,"(3) Some days I'm on the floor surrounded by post-its, trying to delve into key systemic factors to solve a problem - and don't find a satisfying answer."
54,"(2) But this stuff gets heavy. Especially when I'm looking at issues like violence, opioids, systemic racism, poverty - issues where people cannot wait for the stars to align - they need help now."

72,"(3) But that change starts with changing our conversation about race, accepting that we don't live in a post-racial society, and that America is still healing from the wounds of a long history of slavery and oppression."

75,(5) The work done by @DecarceratePA is justice incarnate. I am declaring my commitment to working with them in the future to bring real change and help in whatever way I can. To bring our brothers and sisters home and start to heal our broken families.
76,"(4) And somehow last night, I finally realized why prison reform and ending mass incarceration strikes so deeply with me - my favorite part of nursing is helping people feel human, and stay human, on the worst and most vulnerable days of their lives."
77,"(3) Death by incarceration is very real. People are locked away and forgotten about, dehumanized, statistics in a system that profits from a modern day form of slavery - an extension of structural racism."
78,"(2) I spoke with fellow humans who'd spent decades in jail. Parents with children sentenced to life without parole. Everyone spoke so openly and without judgment. I cried (I usually cry...) because of how beautiful it was to witness true compassion, empathy, and respect."
79,"(1) I think last night changed me, woke up an entire side of my creative brain, and filled a missing piece in my ever changing puzzle that is the social determinants of health. I attended a @DecarceratePA meeting last night, was blessed to meet so many inspiring people."
