2,@charles_gaba @willboydforAL @katrina_senate @VoteKendraOK @BrianBengs @EvanMcMullin I believe that the opposition would eliminate it in a second if it suited their needs. I believe that we are not able to get critical reforms passed because of it. I support eliminating it. It is a false sense of security. We should be focused on our constituents.
