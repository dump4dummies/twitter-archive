1,This is no longer just another midterm election. This is now one of the most consequential elections in history. #OH01
2,This is the first time in history the Supreme Court has reversed a constitutional right. We have to win this. #OH01 https://t.co/yLwF1WF4IS
3,We must codify the rights of Roe into federal law. We must fight to ensure our communities have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions. And we have to vote anti-choice politicians out of office.
4,This is the time for action. The other side is hoping our outrage will turn into despair and hopelessness.
5,"When I’m in Congress, I will never back down in the fight for the personal freedoms of all Americans and I will always oppose any efforts to undermine the privacy between a woman and her doctor."
6,"The Court’s decision will cost lives, and it’s clear that our work has never been more important. My opponent has made it his life’s work to take away the freedoms and privacies protected by Roe."
7,This is an attack on women and personal freedoms. My complete statement: https://t.co/moizScetK1
8,Proud to stand in solidarity with these Starbucks employees in #OH01 and unions everywhere. Working people deserve the power to negotiate. Congratulations to the workers of the 4th &amp; Vine Starbucks! https://t.co/YuCsBbpU5X
9,This morning’s ruling is another reminder to make this #ChabotsLastYear. He’s received the second most direct support from the NRA of the 435 members of the House. He’ll never vote to keep our families here in #OH01 safe. https://t.co/LbewhFwaom
10,"I’m glad that @POTUS is also calling to suspend the federal gas tax. It’ll save us 18 cents a gallon. This gives much-needed relief for our families here at home.

Next, hold Big Oil and Gas accountable for price gouging us at the pump.  #OH01"
11,"This is the right move, but there's no time to waste. We should suspend the federal and state gas tax NOW and deliver relief for folks here at home. #OH01

https://t.co/G6UhSf7A5r"
12,"If you want to understand Chabot’s votes, look at the special interests that fund his campaigns. They pay his campaign bills and we all pay the price.

I’ll always put the children and families here at home first. #OH01"
13,Blessed to continue celebrating #Juneteenth this morning at Cincinnati’s Official Juneteenth Parade. Beautiful day with wonderful people.💙#OH01 https://t.co/90XxOr1GzN

17,"Corporations are reaping record profits all while charging us more and more. Chabot does nothing because his party bosses and corporate donors want to keep it that way.

He’s painfully out of touch with us here at home in #OH01."
18,"Come join us this Saturday to pick up yard signs and get involved with the Ohio Coordinated Campaign. Hope to see you there 🙏🏻💙

19,Pence is in town today to stump for Congressman Chabot. He must have forgotten that Chabot voted with the armed insurrectionists who wanted to “Hang Mike Pence” and throw out legally cast votes. #OH01
20,"Democracy is on the ballot this November. That’s why I am proud to be endorsed by @defendvoting.

Chabot’s decision to throw out votes on January 6th isn’t just dishonorable, it’s disqualifying. When I’m in Congress, I’ll work to protect our democracy and the right to vote. https://t.co/vIUfPqEYfV"
21,Fun Fact: Chabot was first sworn into Congress the year Internet Explorer launched. https://t.co/LujAAoITVk
22,".@JoeyB is right, but we shouldn't stop there. We should ban assault weapons, these weapons of war have no place on the streets of our communities.
https://t.co/DqeFh1hwFp"
23,"The families of #OH01 are struggling with gas prices on the rise. Elected officials have the tools to relieve some of the burden.

Our representatives in Columbus and in Washington need to suspend the state and federal gas tax now. This saves you $0.60 per gallon. That adds up."
24,"We need to protect our schools and communities from gun violence. Unlike Chabot and the other out-of-touch politicians, I'm not bought and paid for by the gun manufacturers and the NRA."
25,"Just weeks after the massacres in Buffalo and Uvalde, it becomes legal to carry a concealed gun in Ohio without a permit.

Ohioans have begged our elected ""leaders"" for years to do something but they continue to make our communities less and less safe.
https://t.co/hrrvfrur6q"
26,Happy #Pride from Westwood’s Second Saturday! Spent yesterday afternoon pouring beer and making new friends 🏳️‍🌈🙏🏻💙 https://t.co/Z4xAaSst7H
27,"It was inspiring to be with @MomsDemand and @OHStudentsforGL today. 

Our country needs gun safety now.

We need guns off of our streets and out of our schools. The only way we’re going to do that is by voting people like Chabot out of office. https://t.co/y9tMHv1y6J"
28,It was great to be with the Terrace Park Democratic Club last night! Local Democrats across #OH01 are fired up to make this #ChabotsLastYear 🙏🏻💙 https://t.co/MyYlKG0vp3
29,"Chabot voted to throw out our legally cast votes on January 6th and has since blocked any attempt to protect the right to vote. His vote on January 6th is disqualifying and he must be voted out.

My full statement: https://t.co/ND0jz4wGZm"
30,"""There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone. But your dishonor will remain.""

Chabot’s decision to side with the insurrectionists and throw out our votes on January 6th is not just dishonorable, it is disqualifying. We must vote him out."
31,No one should be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love. It's really that simple.
32,"Chabot voted against Protecting Our Kids because his party bosses and gun lobby donors told him to.

See below for my complete statement. https://t.co/DjwsE8Xwn5"
33,"Chabot was told by his gun lobby donors and DC bosses to vote against Protecting Our Kids, and he did what they wanted…not what we needed. 

We must replace him."
34,"Chabot is an absolute disgrace. He has refused over and over to do anything at all to protect our children. 

This is why I’m running to replace him. https://t.co/OT5lemFZhF"
35,"Today, Congress is hearing the voices of families shattered by gun violence and Chabot will still refuse to vote in our children’s defense.

What’s it going to take, Chabot? How many more children have to die before you act?"
36,"The big oil and gas companies are out of control. Congress needs to stop their price gouging. In the meantime, suspend the gas tax NOW. Our families need relief. https://t.co/PqC6xtMWVR"
37,"Chabot has made it his life’s work to roll back the rights of women to make their own healthcare decisions. That’s why we have to replace him in #OH01.

Can you retweet and follow to help us get to 9000 followers and make this #ChabotsLastYear?"
38,"Today, we #WearOrange. We honor the lives lost and the families crushed by gun violence.

I’m proud to be supported by @MomsDemand as a Gun Sense Candidate. In Congress, I’ll vote to ban assault weapons and push for common sense gun reform. https://t.co/YUct7FpxeG"
39,I am proud to be endorsed by @NARAL. I’ll fight to protect the fundamental freedom of women to make their own decisions about their bodies. #OH01 https://t.co/RgcvC3p8rc
40,"The only reason gun reform is a debate is because of the gun lobby. We’ve got to protect our children.

Next year, with your help, I will replace a major beneficiary of NRA cash in Congress. Let’s go.
https://t.co/4T1pgxBjYm"
41,"86% of trans youth report thoughts of suicide.
56% of trans youth report having attempted suicide.

These children are just trying to make friends and feel like they belong. This is bullying by the Ohio State Legislature. It is cruel and deadly."
42,"Just one transgender girl in Ohio opted to play women’s high school sports this year. One girl looking for a sense of belonging. And our state legislature is trying to bully her out of playing.

This is a hateful solution to a problem that does not exist. https://t.co/v4TZX0aV37"
43,"Our children are being shot at in school and Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything.

Chabot will vote with the NRA just like he votes with Big Pharma, Big Tech, and the Oil and Gas lobbyists. He’ll continue to vote against our interests until we vote him out."
44,Ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. We have to protect to our children.
45,"RT @HRC: 💖 🤍 💙 🖤  🤎 ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜

46,"As Congress begins to debate how to prevent another mass murder of children, our representatives need to get these weapons of war off our streets. I am calling on Chabot to push to ban assault weapons THIS WEEK. #OH01

My full statement: https://t.co/DnqTUbpCnc"
47,"Today is our end-of-month deadline and unlike my opponent, I’m not taking corporate buy-offs.

I need your help to meet this deadline, keep control of the House, and most importantly, give the children and families of #OH01 a voice in Congress. Chip in: https://t.co/9y486O0B2L"
48,Beautiful Memorial Day parade this morning. Great to be with everyone in Blue Ash. Love the energy! 🇺🇸🙏🏻💙 https://t.co/HkwbOjUvhT
49,Today we remember and honor all of the brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and its freedoms. Their sacrifices will not be forgotten.
50,"Team Landsman was out in full force today at Taste of Cincinnati registering voters, eating our city’s fantastic food, and having fun. Love this community and everyone in it 🙏🏻💙 https://t.co/5NrHUh1A03"
51,"This GOP congressman just announced he supports a common-sense bill to get military assault weapons off the streets. Something Chabot will never do because he always chooses the NRA over all of us.

Good for @RepJacobs. When I’m in Congress next year, I'll be a ‘yes’ vote. #OH01 https://t.co/MmFvzKngko"
52,"Gas was $4.45 per gallon in Mt. Washington this morning. Suspending the gas tax brings it down to $3.88. Chabot is following the orders of his donors and DC party bosses while families here at home struggle. In Congress, I’ll fight to deliver relief to the folks of #OH01."
53,Our families are hurting because of high gas prices. I called for a suspension of the gas tax to deliver immediate relief to the folks of #OH01 a month ago. Suspending these taxes would save $0.60 per gallon at the pump. https://t.co/KdDHsqdNEI
54,Last week Chabot voted against stopping price gouging by oil and gas companies to keep our gas prices high. Why? Because they’re funding his campaign.
55,"Corporations are reaping record profits all while charging us more and more. Chabot’s party bosses and corporate donors want to keep it that way. 

Here’s just one example:"
56,Assault weapons are cash cows for gun manufacturers. Gun lobbyists fund Chabot’s campaign. He sticks to his pattern of putting Washington bosses over our children. That’s why he won’t vote to ban assault weapons. I will.
57,"Over his decades in Washington, Chabot has received the 2nd most direct support from the NRA of anyone in the House. The NRA has even given him more direct contributions than Mitch McConnell. In return, he sits in DC doing nothing to keep our children here at home in #OH01 safe."
58,"Columbine. Sandy Hook. Parkland. Now, Uvalde. Chabot has been in Congress during each of these tragedies.

He doesn't care about keeping our kids safe. He only cares about keeping the NRA and his Washington buddies happy. It's pathetic."
59,"It could've been worse?

19 children were gunned down yesterday.

When I replace this out of touch, gun lobby loyalist in Congress next year, I will vote to ban assault weapons. https://t.co/Ssmq3aeA2N"
60,"“Where in God’s name is our backbone?”

Ban assault weapons and require background checks. It’s a simple vote. And the very least we can do. 

@POTUS tonight - “May God bless the loss of innocent life on this sad day.” 

 https://t.co/2iCglehiIJ"
61,"Congress can’t legislate for every possible scenario, side effect, and consequence of a pregnancy. Banning essential healthcare hurts women, and quite frankly is none of the government’s business. I’ll fight to keep politicians like Chabot out of your doctor’s office. #OH01"
62,Children and families who are already marginalized are hit first in a crisis. Chabot’s vote against a bipartisan effort to get formula back on shelves was uncaring and unforgivable. He stands with his party leaders and not with us here at home in #OH01. https://t.co/bN3LKQzXts
63,"Gas was $4.47 in Mt. Washington this morning. But yesterday you voted against a bill to stop price gouging by the oil &amp; gas companies, hurting our families, because your DC bosses told you to.

The people of #OH01 NEED real relief - not out-of-touch talking points. https://t.co/wcp80WPPLO"
64,"We need a representative who fights for us, not against us. Chabot tweeted about the baby formula crisis on Tuesday and voted against the bill on Wednesday. Such a heartless, uncaring act. I will always put the children and families of #OH01 first. My full statement: https://t.co/t8BtVUvuuu"
65,"On Tuesday, Chabot tweeted about the heartbreaking baby formula shortage. On Wednesday he voted AGAINST a bipartisan bill to do something about it. 

I’m tired of the talking points and partisan BS. I will always fight FOR our children and families, not party bosses. #OH01 https://t.co/QLCehTcukJ"
66,"Unlike Chabot, I’ll work with anyone to deliver for our children and families. It’s what I’ve done in Cincinnati, and what I’ll continue to do in Congress.
If we want a representative who will roll up his sleeves and get things done, we have to make this #ChabotsLastYear."
67,"Chabot proves yet again that he serves his party leaders and corporate donors over the needs of our families in #OH01. He’s voted against bipartisan bills that provide:
❌Lower prescription drug costs
❌Funding for a new bridge
❌Healthcare and disability benefits for Vets https://t.co/JGcXRV8ymP"
68,"Like Vance and Schmidt, Chabot wants to ban abortion even in the case of rape or incest. This policy is government-sanctioned violence that will keep girls and women in cycles of abuse and trauma. The families of #OH01 deserve better, and I’ll always fight for your freedoms."
69,"Schmidt, Vance, Chabot….these local Republicans all care more about controlling women than protecting them. For your safety and freedom, we HAVE to make this #ChabotsLastYear."
70,Proud to stand with @PPFA &amp; @PPSWO today and every day in support of the fundamental freedom for women to make their OWN decisions about their OWN bodies. #OH01 #BansOffOurBodies https://t.co/cy8N80ToJ0

72,"I'll work with anyone to keep our children and families safe. While Chabot encourages chaos and division in Washington, I'm organizing folks to deliver for the families of #OH01. 

I’m proud of the work we're doing in Cincinnati, and I won't stop fighting for our communities. https://t.co/Io26eTsAPk"
73,"Last night, I was out knocking doors in Mariemont and talked to a lot of teachers. As a former teacher who’s been doing childhood advocacy work my entire life, I know how important this work is. I’m ready to fight for the children and families of #OH01 in Congress. https://t.co/OYr3hkT3px"
74,$4.39 a gallon today in Mt. Washington. @SteveChabot would rather point fingers than actually do the work to get costs down. Suspend the gas tax NOW. #OH01 https://t.co/5xj7YsJKLo
75,Chabot was at it again last year when he voted against the infrastructure package to replace the #BrentSpenceBridge. You don’t get to keep screwing us over and keep your job. #ChabotsLastYear #OH01
76,Steve Chabot and other Washington politicians denied Cincinnati the funds to replace the Western Hills Viaduct. We built a team and organized folks across Hamilton County to get it done.
77,"There’s a lot of work to be done, and we’re going to need all of you to win this race in November. Chip in today and help us flip #OH01 and keep the Democratic majority: https://t.co/27VkKdDqQ3"
78,"This makes #OH01 one of the best pickup opportunities in the country. Chabot votes against lowering costs for our working families and clearly doesn't care about us anymore. I’m running to put our children and families first, not corporate donors. https://t.co/j38E4fnHFc"
79,"After decades of hiding behind a gerrymander that split Cincinnati in two, Chabot now has to run in our entire City. President Biden would have won this new district by nearly 9 points, a 12 point swing from the previous decade. https://t.co/xUpOYfCY4m"
80,"ICYMI: Yesterday, Politico named our race in #OH01 one of the most critical races to maintain control of the House in 2022. Here’s why 🧵: https://t.co/lz7mVefMrT"
81,"This morning, Politico named #OH01 one of the most critical races to maintain control of the House in 2022.

83,".@POTUS, @SenRobPortman, and @SenSherrodBrown are investing in infrastructure and our workers (Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, COMPETES Act). Chabot voted no on both measures. He’s undermining our workers and our families. Let's make it #ChabotsLastYear. https://t.co/rIIBEhydzg"

88,My kids go to public school in #OH01. Education is everything. That's why I led the charge to pass the Cincinnati Preschool Promise. I’ll never stop fighting for our children. I’m ready to take this fight to Congress.
89,"Right now, teachers are under immense pressure. We are asking them to do more with fewer resources. As a former public school teacher, I know that teachers need policymakers who understand firsthand the difficulties of being an educator."
90,"One year, realizing the curriculum wouldn’t work for her students, she threw it out and built a café in her classroom where she taught her students real life skills. Then, she went out and found each of her students good jobs. She's my hero."
