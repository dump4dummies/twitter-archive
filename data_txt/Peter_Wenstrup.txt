16,Education first. #TeacherForSenate https://t.co/bZvysEEWCT
17,"A pastor in Washington Parish told me about the impact of drugs in his community. Drug overdoses have skyrocketed since @SenBillCassidy took office. He always finds money to give Wall Street a tax cut, but never delivers resources to protect our loved ones."
18,#TeacherForSenate https://t.co/p2vUqmWAFT
19,"We need someone who understands the education system, to bring us from the bottom of national rankings to the top. I believe that it is time we elect a #TeacherForSenate."

21,"Just finished hurricane #Zeta prep with Grace. Kristen and Hope are teaching remotely. Please take a look around the neighborhood and see if anyone needs last minute help, then stay safe."
22,As a baseball coach I learned that well all win together or we all lose together. Senate republicans like @BillCassidy  have built their careers on dividing us. It‚Äôs time to unite instead. https://t.co/K6TPxO0Uqh
23,"As a teacher and father, I'm deeply concerned about lead exposure for our children. Investing in our future means clean water for our children. From St. Joseph to Alexandria, let's put people back to work replacing dangerous lead pipes and lead paint. https://t.co/x19rv5hjcy"
24,Catch us today at 3:00pm on 102.3 FM in New Orleans on Dig This! with Monica Lark talking about food security and how we eliminate food deserts in Louisianaüëç

31,"Students had a lot of skepticism about government: what it means to be a politician, whether our democracy hears all voices, and whether our checks and balances still work. As a non-politician, I share those concerns. As a math teacher, I'm always eager to work towards solutions!"
32,"This morning, I had an opportunity this morning to jump on Zoom with ninth graders from the @livingschool as part of a series of interviews they did with elected officials. I loved the fact that the students were empowered to lead the interviews, and they asked amazing questions!"
33,Been on the road every night for the last week. Was good to be able to catch dinner and a book with the girls last night. https://t.co/euXrq1qYDk

35,"This evening, I met with folks from the Citizen's Climate Lobby. I am proud to be the candidate in this race that is listening to grassroots leaders on the environment. Economic prosperity begins with education which begins with* clean air and water, and a healthy environment."
36,Thank you for sending this to me üòÇ https://t.co/kVSGZT3R01
37,"Ten years, we bailed out Wall Street and corporations and millions of people were out of work for years. You voted against a bill the saved 2,000 teacher jobs in Louisiana. We know that you'll cut support before Louisiana working families are taken care of, so we demand better. https://t.co/oeoTOJffOl"
38,"Last night in St James, I spoke with residents about the need for clean air and clean water. The EPA is failing us, and we need to empower residents with facts to fight against this type of pollution. https://t.co/GwpgC4kakF"

Finally, she had some words about my driving: ‚ÄúOooh Peter, watch out for the ditch! You almost gave me a heart attack.‚Äù"
41,"Her number two priority is good jobs for her kids. 

I found out that she‚Äôs a graduate of Walter L Cohen high school, where I taught, and we lived in the same lot ‚ÄúAcross the street from the washateria on one corner and barroom across the street.‚Äù"
42,Her number one concern is air quality. She‚Äôs had stage 1 cancer. As have so many people she knows living in the shadows of these chemical plants. We had an opportunity to visit with Sharon Lavigne of Rise St James and talk about the prayer and march coming up on October 31st.
43,"Spent the evening with Ms. Janice, queen of St. James Parish. 

She told me about how important family is here. Lots of families live 4-5 families on one street. People are there for each other. https://t.co/qNgKXrqT2Q"

54,Pro-business should mean holding firm on rules so folks who care about their communities and employees succeed.
55,"Want to pay a living wage? You‚Äôll get undercut by someone who won‚Äôt.

Want to protect the environment? You‚Äôll be forced out of business by a polluter.

Want to pay your fair share of taxes? You‚Äôll get bought out by a firm that dodges."
56,"A teacher knows that when you don‚Äôt stand firm on your rules, you punish those who follow them. Our government, corrupted by special influence, repeatedly punished business owners who act with integrity. https://t.co/Z4lxsJaRQC"
57,"@SenBillCassidy Sir, when you run for re-election, you're supposed to talk about thinks you've done. You had six years. You served in a 51-49 Senate where you could have actually brokered bipartisan deals. 

We need solutions, not talk. That's why it's time for a #TeacherforSenate"

71,"172 days since @SenBillCassidy passed any relief for folks in Louisiana. There's the moral cruelty of allow folks to suffer for a pandemic that was no fault of their own, and then there's the stupidity of starving small businesses of customers.
https://t.co/heZyvekWya"
72,"Economic development = funding education and internet access. Let's build a Louisiana that can thrive in tomorrow's economy!

https://t.co/Ps7scp5yXc"

76,"Finally, I ran into Roke, a former student and a restaurant manager. He spoke about the connections he made working at Commander's Palace and a network of up-and-coming talent. Every day that @SenBillCassidy does nothing, we risk losing the talent that fuels our economy."
77,"I walked by an older woman with a knife engaged in a domestic dispute. She asked for my phone to call 911. As I dialed, she signaled that she wanted me to fake the call. We must allow cities to add social workers to their 911 response so folks like her get the support they need."
78,"Nearby, I met a gentleman who couldn't vote but had a lot to say. He's angry that Washington has let the virus devastate his community. Every teacher knows how much you can accomplish by giving someone a voice. When folks have served their time, they deserve to vote."
79,"As I was walking away from one house, a shout came from down the block: ""Hey, come back!"" When I returned I saw Christina, whom I taught math at W. L. Cohen. She's now in her third year at Loyola studying accounting. I'm incredibly proud that I got to be part of her journey."
80,"She spoke about the foundation she had from her grandmother and her sisters. 

She said, ""Every need has a need."" When she starts her business, she wants to help folks out. ""Everyone's back is against the wall right now""- we need to support each other."
81,"I met Bridgette, who attended Walter L Cohen, but didn't walk at graduation bc her aunt couldn't pay the budget. She recently completed tech training and works with AI. She plans to start a business. We are stronger when we empower folks of all ages with access to education."
82,"I had an amazing morning. This campaign is founded upon the idea that hope, that unity, that solutions come from empowering people in our communities. Too often, politicians take our power to Washington and keep it. We need to elect folks that deliver that power to communities. https://t.co/BQ4nixHDlA"
83,Let‚Äôs not forget @SenBillCassidy took a 3 WEEK(!) vacation as businesses like The Circle Bar continued to suffer and has yet to put the people of Louisiana first and bring much needed relief to our state. Enough is a enough. #TeacherForSenate https://t.co/OiI8UCpm4b

89,The @LaDemos and @AFLCIO endorsed a candidate that doesn't support a $15 minimum wage. This is why people don't vote.
90,I love seeing people in the community organizing and activating. Our strength lies in the people. This campaign is about empowering folks like Reyan to have their voices heard. #TeacherForSenate
91,"Meeting folks in Harmony Oaks, Uptown New Orleans yesterday. I listened to Sherry and Reyan speak about health outcome disparities for women of color, especially during childbirth. Reyan has founded a group called Battle for Judah based on her child‚Äôs experience at birth. https://t.co/VeAGr5jdpE"
92,"My wife, Kristen, works at this school - I'm so amazed at the cool things they are doing there.  This school shows what's possible when community members and families are empowered to make decisions about what is best for their children. https://t.co/yYEr07Bz41"
93,"A new poll shows US as having the best chance among Democrats to defeat Bill Cassidy in a runoff! Come join us this weekend as we continue to grow this grassroots campaign and if you can‚Äôt make it, chip in a few dollars to help us defeat Republican Bill Cassidy. https://t.co/kndmzpl5Wz"
