4,"Im glad the women who fought for voting rights and the amazing people who led the civil rights movement didn’t say “this is too hard.”

We owe it to future generations to do exactly what they did to give us our rights. Except now we have even more tools at our disposal."

27,@Valkyrie_sKnave @AOC @SenSanders @ewarren Yes thank you!!!
28,@TheCiroth Exactly. We need @AOC and @SenSanders and the unions just as starting point to lead this but I think even more. I hope that’s where their mind is at or going
29,@santiagomayer_ @VictoriaLBruce Oh I realize.
30,@JoshForNY @POTUS Can anyone at all challenge this guy for 2024? Time to put the niceties of letting someone keep office aside.
31,"@TheCiroth I love it and of course will participate but it has to be even bigger than prime day. Think if every single union has their workers stop working. And the rest of us join in. No movies, no tv, no transport, no teachers, nada until we get what we want."
32,Our government wants poor underprivileged babies that grow up in poverty working 3 jobs at $7.25/hr so they can continue to benefit from the  the separation of classes and working people vs. oligarchs. Hit them where it hurts. Cut off their $$$

34,"We have to fix this without any help from the White House. 

I believe what we need are general strike and protests that just don’t end until something is done.

57,@POTUS So what are you DOING to help us???
58,@TheRewiredSoul Yes we do which is why it’s still important to vote even though people like to say they won’t anymore
59,@TheRewiredSoul @ThinkerAspiring I know that’s the argument but we can just keep going until there we are all Supreme Court justices and then it turns into a direct democracy if they wanna play that way. It’s beyond time to hope 9 lifetime appointed people get this right.
60,@MrXArt1 @SenatorSinema I do want the filibuster gone. Idk if you have read how legislation works but it wouldn’t just apply to one side.
61,@TheRewiredSoul Or get Fetterman and one more senator in. Then make dc a state which takes 50 votes.
62,@TheRewiredSoul It’s possible with 50 votes + VP.
63,@robertfr69 @Sen_JoeManchin We don’t even need bipartisanship tho- we just needed him! He alone bears much responsibility for todays events.
64,@SenatorSinema The nerve of you and Manchin to post absolutely anything today. You wanna fix this? End the filibuster and make DC a state. Otherwise leave the Senate. You’re no better than an actual MAGA senator who would replace you.
65,"@Sen_JoeManchin By the way if you’re personally pro life but want women to have the ability to choose, you’re actually pro choice! You should really speak with planned parenthood or someone to learn the basics so you can advocate better from your platform."
66,"@Sen_JoeManchin How are you surprised?? We have ALL been telling you and Sinema for years and you two have held up any protections. Do something immediately, end the filibuster and make DC a state. YOU are holding this all up."
67,"This doesn’t mean I love the democrats and especially doesn’t mean I even like Biden, who helped Thomas get his lifetime appointment. It just means short of some form of revolution where we all come together and strike or something, the little power we have left is our voice."
68,"As much as it feels cathartic to say “fuck it I’m not voting anymore” if we lose congress and the presidency for 4 more years, you truly haven’t seen anything yet. It is still important to vote but people like Clarence Thomas love when we say it’s not."
69,It takes 50 votes + VP  to expand the Supreme Court and undo this all.
70,We need to make DC a state and and support PR if they choose to be a state as well. Potentially 4 more senators.
71,"We need to end the filibuster. It will take 50 votes plus the VP. If we win two more seats this cycle, we can just pass this."
72,"It doesn’t end here. As much as I feel it too, for my mental health I gotta mute the people saying “we’re fucked. We can never fix this. We cant do anything.” I don’t have the luxury of giving up as I grow a daughter in my body. 

Here is a thread of real things we can do https://t.co/0UBa7Xr1El"
73,@noisybrooklyn1 Works for me!
74,There is no constitutional right to AR-15s. By all means everyone can get muskets like our founding fathers had. Just saying. For the legislators.

79,@daveanthony Exactly what I’m saying if DOJ doesn’t do anything
80,"If all of these elites can walk away from Jan 6 unscathed, I’m scared for the next level of shenanigans. 

Elites need to face the same laws and rules that the rest of us do.

89,We need 50 votes to make DC A STATE. Once we get 52 senators we need to make that happen and add an extra buffer to make manchin and sinema even more obsolete.
90,"@BoxNews11 I’m here for that too. SOMETHING, ANYTHING"
91,"With ASSHOLES like manchin and sinema on the senate, we need two more senators willing to do their jobs. I am willing to try one last fucking time to get 50 votes. When we have 52 senators and still can’t do shit I’m out of here."
92,"We need 50 fucking votes to expand the Supreme Court and install 1,000,000 18 year old lesbians so we can tell Clarence Thomas to go fuck himself. 

50 votes.

50.

We only 50 votes.

We are inches away from being able to fix ALL OF THIS. We just need 50."
