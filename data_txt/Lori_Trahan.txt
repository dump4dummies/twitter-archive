12,"Big Oil companies bought cheap Russian oil to increase their record-setting profits while their CEOs pocketed millions personally. They’re okay with that as long as working families are the ones paying for it.

I called them out for their greed yesterday. https://t.co/twbHSbOYfk"
13,"Last week, 193 Republicans opposed capping the price of insulin at $35 a month.

People are literally risking their lives having to ration their overpriced prescriptions and yet somehow, 95 percent of the House GOP still voted with big pharma.

20,"The Republican plan raises taxes on working families, with the majority of those tax increases targeting households making less than $54,000 a year.

That’s not a plan to rebuild America. It’s a giveaway to the rich — and they want you to pay for it. https://t.co/NYel4YYEBF"
