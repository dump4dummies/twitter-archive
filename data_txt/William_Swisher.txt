0,@VictorBlackwell it's time for an update on the Trump gumballs.
1,@IlhanMN Don't get me wrong I support legalization but that stat is like polling people at a Phish concert... 95% of them would probably support legalization of marijuana.
2,@Orionca14 @kennyhorsley @sonofmikeh @AndrewYang The Continental Army was a militia and the US Army is a national military branch.. thus why we had the second Amendment although there's no real need for it based on the reasoning behind it at the time.
3,@Benzamna @AndrewYang I think you're missing a Klan meeting while spewing your hate online... If you hurry you might make it for the Cross burning.
4,#MyTimeIsUp #passthetorch It's time for Biden to bow out gracefully.
5,"@AnthonyVClark @cenkuygur @GOP Not that I'm defending Biden (far from it) but at least he didn't refer to an entire culture of people as ""superpredators."""
6,@kgopinion What else is new?  Lol.
7,@kgopinion I'm always helping Bernie.  :)
8,I've looked at each serious candidate for President and the only candidate I see that truly is compassionate and is trustworthy is Bernie Sanders.  Sorry but I won't vote for a candidate whom I cannot trust for any office.  This is also why I must primary Cheri Bustos in #IL17.

13,Unless we get an apology from @reedhastings and @netflix I will be cancelling my Netflix subscription tomorrow and urge others join me.  We must stand up for a woman's right to choose.
14,"I'm very proud to honor our service men and women today and ask only two things.  One, that our country only goes to war when absolutely necessary to defend ourselves and our allies. Two, that we treat our veterans with the respect and dignity they deserve."
15,"@AnthonyVClark This is especially needed in Rockford where almost all houses, apartments, buildings are so old they don't require meeting ADA guidelines being ""grandfathered in."". I say we make all buildings be brought up to meet ADA guidelines by no later than 2035."
16,@ShiaKapos how come none of your reporting on Cheri Bustos mentions she too has a primary she must face?  https://t.co/gOVRM2sDWH
17,@NRATV And the Republican Party used to be the progressive party... Times change @NRATV  but unfortunately you can't bring a family member back to life after they've lost theirs to gun violence.

23,@AOC Please support our candidacy and give relevance to the Illinois insurgency between @Marie4Congress  @AnthonyVClark and myself @Swisher4IL.
24,This is a sickening message the Treasury Dept. Under Trump is playing by not rolling out the Tubman $20 in 2020. Apparently right wing Trump neo-cons still don't accept persons of color nor are they willing to grant them recognition.
25,We used to treat whistleblowers with respect in this country now lawmakers and policy makers on both sides of the aisle treat them like enemies of the state.  #FreeManning #FreeJulian

45,@thinkprogress huge fan of your work and proud progressive.  I'd love it if you guys would do a story on my running against Cheri Bustos the DCCC Chair in a primary.  We need to stop her anti-Democratic ways and support of Pro-Abortion Democrats like Dan Lipinski.
46,@lukeobrien I'm running against DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos in IL-17th in a primary.  I hear extremism is your thing and as Bustos continues to threaten to blacklist women like Marie Newman for challenging Anti-Abortion Democrats like Lipinski I need your help to gain exposure.

55,@AOC please consider endorsing my campaign. It's legit and we're facing off against Cheri Bustos the DCCC Chairwoman we need the support of progressives like yourself.
56,I support Bernie's ban on for-profit charter schools.  Many of these fail our children and when money is the top reason you've opened a school you've already lost the point.  Our children are the top reason and giving them anything less than a quality education shouldn't stand.
57,It's official people I have informed the FEC of the campaign.  We're off and running now! https://t.co/LrFfyRab0z
58,@Mark_Shriver can you message me with ways Congress could help reunite families at the border and things we should be doing to keep families from being separated?  I believe this is a critical issue that needs much more exposure.
59,@OurRevolution @AllOnMedicare Because people like @RepCheri @CheriBustos refuse to take a public stance in support of #MedicareForAll which is why I'm primarying her in Illinois 17th.  The people demand and the people deserve proper healthcare as a basic human right.
