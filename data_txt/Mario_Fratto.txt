2,"RINOs have infiltrated the Republican party! @ClaudiaTenney has an F rating from Conservative Review! Yes, @Liz_Cheney is a total RINO, but there are even worse! Help me defeat Claudia Tenney at https://t.co/vojUaUGqBo https://t.co/yNrhoJuCXo"

10,@JordanSchachtel Wasn’t the $53 billion that the Dems and RINOs sent them enough? Of course not.
11,@Andyharrisfan I love my Wayne County people! 💪🏼🙏🇺🇸
12,"When @ClaudiaTenney voted to send millions of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood , @Jim_Jordan said “This is the worst bill I've seen in my time in Congress by far.” 

We need to elect real conservatives who will fight for life when it’s hard, not just when it’s easy! #NY24 https://t.co/WIFKXNjCIl"
13,"The Supreme Court decisions from yesterday and today uphold the fundamental rights to LIFE, and the right to protect that life, for the born and UNBORN! The last two days have been truly incredible! God bless America! #2A #Life"

17,"@RealRickGlaser1 Yes, I don’t really see what he could have done differently. He went from never being down in his life to going down easy. Beterbiev is too strong!"
18,"Happy Father’s Day to my amazing dad and all of the incredible dads out there! Thank you for teaching me that it isn’t the outcome that matters, but if you gave it your best shot. Now that I am a father myself, I can only hope that my son will be as proud of me as I am of you! https://t.co/lwr5F1ji2y"

https://t.co/4Yt6NEs4O0 https://t.co/hkEnBdkOcc"
24,@DrPaulGosar You are one of the true conservatives that didn't vote for Red Flag laws and didn't vote to send our money to Ukraine! Keep fighting! #AmericaFirst

31,"@HAPhillips71 @claudiatenney I disagree with this bill…Pointing out policy differences isn’t “bashing” people.  One of my main qualifications is not being a politician who is backed by the establishment. I can’t fit the rest, but you can find it at the link below. Take care Heath!

34,"Many of the “good Republicans”aren’t anything more than RINOs with good PR teams. 

Too many Republicans claim to be America First and their voting record is worse than Liz Cheney’s!
Right, @claudiatenney?  #NY24 https://t.co/MELfiMi5YK"
35,@GavinWax Congratulations brother! I wish we had a million more fighters like you!
36,"Congress wasn't meant to be a full-time job, let alone a career. The establishment wants to install DC insiders to keep their corrupt system intact. The last thing we need is another politician with ""experience.""

43,"@RepTroyNehls @TrumpWarRoom @CapitolPolice I was at the inauguration in 2017, if those animals were allowed access to the White House or Capitol there would have been something much worse than J6!"
44,@BarnettforAZ We probably need to get rid of the bottom half of the House GOP to make it happen!
45,@charliekirk11 We always talk about the “line in the sand” well I think this should be it for us. No more compromising with the Democrats.
46,"@ReturnNormalcy @MillerStanIL Unfortunately, Liz Cheney has a higher conservative rating than every single Republican member from NY!
https://t.co/vMjT2dLyQl"
47,@BarnettforAZ This is what happens when you give up your sovereignty!
48,@JackPosobiec Sounds like RINO/Dem Speak
49,@LorenCulp So do all of the RINOs that voted for amnesty! We have to take them all down….
50,@ChristinaPushaw This is an organized indoctrination and destruction of traditional family values. How disgusting….
51,@RichRodgers55 @gregkellyusa @KathyHochul Thank you my friend!
52,@gregkellyusa @KathyHochul We have had the worst run of Governors in U.S History and it isn’t even close!

54,@joeygilbertinc We also need to get rid of the RINOs too.....Too many of them sending our money overseas and putting America Last!
55,"Sponsoring a transgender rights bill allowing men to follow girls into bathrooms is way beyond the pale. 

We need to clean house in the Republican Party and it starts with @claudiatenney and the rest of these RINOs! #NY24

59,@KamVTV Basically anybody who watches CNN or MSNBC
60,"@BogetoftHans @ACTBrigitte I’ve been to about 35 countries, and lived abroad as well. Don’t give me that globalist garbage. What happens in Ukraine has a much greater effect on Europe than it does on us, yet they are contributing three times less than we are to the war effort. That’s sickening….."
61,@ScottPresler Nice work!
62,"@ACTBrigitte Joe, Dems and RINOs will lift tariffs on China and send more money to Ukraine. They keep selling us out for the globalist agenda!"
63,"Real conservative @laurenboebert refuses to vote for amnesty and calls out @claudiatenney's vote for H.R. 1603 for what it is: Amnesty and a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegals! 

We need more Lauren Boeberts and fewer Claudia Tenneys! #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/lvdaN78DMH"
64,@AndyHarrisFan @RandyRRQuaid The guy has given more wrong answers than @AOC on an economics exam.....

They both rank in the bottom 10% of House GOP…"
71,@revjmcguire This is just insanity!
