2,"@lookforsun It's about not being selfish. Every generation owes it to ones behind it to help them rise and take leadership. I can write books forever and young people can still write books. But in politics, there are limited slots; staying too long makes it impossible for others to rise up."
3,@dannybarefoot Totally disagree.
4,"Given that there are only so many slots in political leadership, octogenarians - with the exception of Bernie Sanders, who has achieved whatever-he-wants-he-should-get status-  should step aside."
5,@MickBeeBlues We're always been both/and.
6,@michaelbrandorg Not all of them
7,"@DuerksenKen No, the way to fix it is to vote in those who are NOT ""treacherous caretakers."" https://t.co/HKaiUaswuU"
8,"@michaelbrandorg I heard some college kids talk about the ""mistakes"" made by the ""hippie generation,"" and I said, ""Like what, that we weren't corporate whores?"""
9,"@SienaandToast No! With Martin and Bobby and McCarthy and so many others, it felt like there were those in an older generation fighting for us! It's why the assassinations were so devastating."
10,"There's a spirt of renewal that's key to the American character, as obvious in our youth today as in any other generation. 

The difference now is that those meant to be the caretaker of that spirt, to protect our right to express it, are serving the very forces that suppress it."
11,"@NetBoyRick2pt0 The laws that are now taking effect in almost half the country are absolutely more restrictive than the UK. Usually I would agree with you about respecting our institutions, but our institutions are now failing us in ways that deserve the most passionately expressed disrespect."
12,"@NetBoyRick2pt0 I usually agree with you regarding people going to another country and putting down their own. But in a virtual age she’s speaking to people, particularly young women, everywhere. The spirit of protest here is healthy &amp; courageous. We need it going into November"
13,Good. https://t.co/JjXuXNNK0f
14,"Join me Tuesday night to hear from the non-corporate backed https://t.co/HKaiUaswuU endorsees who have won their primaries and now move on to the general. Who are they, what do they stand for, and how can we help? https://t.co/exgZV0LenK"
15,"On ""Rising"" this morning to discuss Roe v. Wade, the Democrats, how we got here and what happens now ... https://t.co/2bB2jhvT1q"
16,"Just what we need in America right now … more fear and division … people turning against each other… more reasons for despair… violence perpetrated against women whose boyfriends or husbands get angry that they’re pregnant. 

This turn of events is anything but pro-life. https://t.co/GrGbu7oCBU"
17,@fohouttahere I appreciate the conversation but I’ll pretty much continue to say what I want. (Not really the week for a man to be telling any woman what she can and cannot say.) I don’t need to co-opt anybody else’s rhetoric to express my opinion. After 14 books I pretty much say what I think
18,"Why are police treating protesters and journalists like criminals? 

Are we just supposed to accept now that institutions set up to protect people will be regularly abusing them? https://t.co/5p5wZ6bVHM"
19,@highroadsaloon Your wife is absolutely correct.
20,Processing the moment with my friend @kthalps
21,An attack on women. https://t.co/0boyXOwq8Q
22,"@fohouttahere You said ""unlimited accumulation.""  I look at certain hybrid economies of Europe and think they're basically fine."
23,@fohouttahere Unlimited capital accumulation absolutely is part of the problem
24,@MaxMurrayShow The alt right agenda being forced on the country right now IS the extreme agenda.
25,@mjs_DC Yep
26,It’s shocking to me that there are still people who think we just need to tweak things a little bit here and tweak things a little bit there.

32,"@POTUS Wow, really? If only we had a Democratic president who could do something about this. #EndTheFilibuster"
33,"If Democrats are thinking the fury of this moment will pass, then they are mistaken. 

If they think it will all turn into support *for* them rather than anger *at* them, they are also mistaken. 

Democrats should do something massive &amp; tangible for people pretty much right now."
34,"@ljsweetman1 That is exactly what I'm saying. Not a ""liberal"" majority, by the way, but one aligned with the will of the people (63% of Americans support abortion rights) as opposed to dominance by a small minority."
35,"@BeezusQuimby3 What is it you would have her do? The bully pulpit is of itself a way to harness power, and she's using hers to say things that are much further out on a limb than anything her leadership is saying. She's one person out of 435."
36,"Guts and courage award to AOC this week. At a time when Democratic leadership is facing a fundamental attack on women with mealy mouthed whining and fundraising appeals, she's courageously gone on the offensive and shown some spine."
37,@neon_evangayion You would think. Can’t quite figure out what it is she thinks I did
38,Exactly https://t.co/NLxxafresb
39,@hunniebeezer @offbeatorbit Wow
40,@Corp8myBaby The Constitution is not the problem. A political establishment that's become a system of legalized bribery is the problem.

51,"In states all over the country, people are working hard to get elected so they can dismantle democratic institutions once they get there.

It's hard to defend ourselves against attacks on democracy when they're coming from within the government.

52,@CareDorghalli @latimes I’m impressed
53,@marksmeandering I respect that you do. But you have no right to impose that belief onto others. This is an issue of private not public morality.
54,"For many of the people who have worked so hard to make this happen, their real problem is not really with abortion; it’s with women having sex that’s not under the control of a man. They’re trying to roll back an era of sexual freedom."
55,"Of the 13 trigger laws set to go into effect only five of them include exceptions for rape or incest.

Also in those states, the severe criminalization of doctors for performing abortions will make it difficult for any woman to get an abortion there.

This will cause so much pain"
56,@douglaswburns @KimReynoldsIA This is a terrifying thread
57,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

The Republicans have never looked so mean as they do today and the Democrats have never looked so clueless. https://t.co/owa2NHRymk"
58,@SadieMills19 They were asked how they saw it. They lied.
59,"@ChuckMonsanto No, I did not say that. I'm simply describing human behavior."
60,"Interesting that Dem leadership are all ""stunned"" by this decision.

I don't know why they would be. 

They've been telling us in fundraising letters for years that this would happen, though they chose to do nothing about it except send more fundraising letters.

Do something NOW"
61,I can't even https://t.co/ubrOsphdTe
62,@JuliannaForlano Pretty much. Never leave again!
63,"The president gave us a good history lesson and I appreciate his sadness, but if the Dems would end the filibuster they could handle this NOW. Telling us to just vote for more Dems in Nov is not enough.

(NY AG Letitia James has the energy &amp; conviction on this that's needed now)."
64,"Telling people we'll do something IF YOU VOTE FOR US IN NOVEMBER, when people already gave you majorities however slim RIGHT NOW, is guaranteed only to make people angrier.

If Daddy abuses you &amp; Mommy wrings her hands but won't do anything about it, you grow up enraged at Mommy."
65,@SadieMills19 Not at all.

68,"The Democrats in both House and Senate need to get really busy right now, no bullshit or wringing of hands allowed, or they will never again hold serious political power in this country.

 If every there was a decisive moment it's now."
69,"Got a text just now from Pelosi asking for $ so Dems can win in Nov &amp; fight back on this - when she supported Cuellar, the last pro-choice Dem in the House - is everything that's wrong with the Democrats. 

So much they should have done &amp; could have done. Pelosi should resign now"
70,@silveroinks I did!
71,The only thing more powerful than a waking giant is a waking giantess.
72,"This will change us. It SHOULD change us. Irreparable harm is going to be done, great suffering will occur because of this. Never again should women assume our rights will be protected by anyone but ourselves.

I hope lots of young women are thinking now ""Damn it, I'm gonna run."""

74,"If the universe has a voice it's saying this now: ""Women, over to you."""
75,"Never since the days of the Suffragettes have American women had such a reason to rise up against institutional abuse.

87,@CEKavanagh I’m a Jew. I’m aware of his prejudices &amp; perceived political limitations in order to keep Southern senators aligned with his policies. But I can also see beyond that &amp; appreciate his profound contributions. If we’re looking for perfection there’s no reason to read history at all.
88,"@StephaniLorentz Actually, right now I sort of wonder if that’s even true. We’re doing pretty good in the species suicide department ourselves."
89,"An endless conversation about guns does not include the voices of children, who themselves are the biggest victims. 

Gun violence is the biggest cause of death among children, whose safety should be our highest priority and not somewhere down on the list.

91,"@SofiasDad814 @bonediggy0081 We just keep pushing. There’s no one place or one thing. It’s every place and everything. Every election, every movement activity, becoming a nonviolent guerrilla movement for political change. It’s already begun. Look at what’s happening with labor etc"

95,"People will die because of this. 

And to be very clear, they’re not doing this to protect the 2nd Amendment. They’re doing it to protect the primacy of property rights. That’s why so many millions of $ were spent getting them onto the Court to begin with. https://t.co/RwnR50qG4e"
96,"@SofiasDad814 @bonediggy0081 A non-violent political revolution, absolutely. The Abolitionists, Women Suffragettes, and Civil Rights workers didn’t just wring their hands and say it couldn’t be done. It was seemingly impossible but they made it happen anyway. So can we."
97,@mendez_rod @ProudSocialist Yeah because mommy could walk and chew gum at the same time. We’re losing Roe v. Wade because of a Republican president getting to appoint 3 SCOTUS justices
