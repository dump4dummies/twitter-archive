0,@DouglasWalton99 @voterachelbaker Next week folks we gather for @Isaacsohn before the Mt. Washington parade! Save the date: July 3rd 4-6pm!
1,Reunited ❤️ @DouglasWalton99 Thanks for coming out to support @voterachelbaker and for bringing treats for the girls! https://t.co/8f8gKzkW3b
2,"@voterachelbaker is running for office as an Ohio state rep for all of the right reasons: zero ego or power grabs - just a smart, strong, and good woman who wants to make Ohio a better place to live for her kids, all kids, and all Ohioans! #backingbaker https://t.co/r5uQKKk10w"
3,@WhoctorDo_ Idk - I was thinking about how he can win and flip a senate seat. I think donating to him is an active way to fight back. GOTV is THE most important thing to do however!
4,Teaching this morning and I get this notification and have to keep it together and keep going. I’m scared for their futures though. We will sit in this space of mad/sad/scared - but fighting back for human rights (because many are on the table!) is next https://t.co/nlQAICcXPt
5,@DouglasWalton99 Yes! Either one! They will be thrilled and literally eating out of your hand! 😊
6,@DouglasWalton99 Just no rawhide stuff but any should be  ok! Are you coming to meet @voterachelbaker on Saturday??
7,@nikki8knitter @mike_moroski @FHSchools You can send your kids to Mt. Washington School and still live in Anderson also - it’s important to note that CPS has an open enrollment. I think ppl should stay and fight back in Anderson but know there are safe options for schools in the meantime
8,@jeffreysms @Kevin_D_Shaw Can we paint the roads white? https://t.co/XnWFWTHE8I
9,"State level politics is super important. Rachel has an August 2nd primary and is looking to represent District 27 (eastern and some central Hamilton County). Give her a follow folks, and if you live in 27, she is worth your vote. Check her out! #backingbaker https://t.co/ONE2rA1Fl4"
10,Happy #juneteenth2022 and Happy #FathersDay It’s a beautiful day in Cincinnati!

13,@tehannessy @CincyParks @AftabPureval We passed as they were setting up and a nice young lady stopped me and my child inviting us to the event. I told her my issues with her faith and she gave the impression that this group was welcoming.  So much for that. Glad we declined.
14,It was an explore the city kind of afternoon - Cincinnati was hopping on this gorgeous day! We were thankful for the @CB_Connector https://t.co/pdEboo5opB

17,This humidity level is so much nicer than that of the last few days 😓 Greyhounds have thin skin so Chevelle has to wear this onesie to cover a mystery cut on her side. But we are starting off a nice 3-day #juneteenth2022 weekend. No summer school Monday in observance @IamCPS https://t.co/AVWT60dTyO

19,@KentuckySpirits Lol - backing! That’s what I get for rushing the post!

21,@mzeleznik You have to use the letters that have already been revealed- no guesses that are just for eliminating letters. It makes you use each guess in a more careful way - intentional to looking specifically for the answer. Scores with the * indicate you’re on that setting.
22,"@_japyt @andypfrone @jeffreysms I think one roadblock for some folks is the pickup and planting of the trees. It’s one thing to want one, but another to be able to execute the process. Maybe if we had help for those situations?!"

25,@andypfrone @jeffreysms Is there a way to expand the program that would not limit the trees to being just along the street? It would be great to offer trees for anywhere on a property. We could even focus on neighborhoods that need it the most @jeffreysms ?!

27,@AlfonsoSly @FlottmanAnne @PVParikh @CityOfCincy Right now we could use all the spray ground and pools open! This will hopefully be a higher priority looking at future summers. Our neighborhood pool serves the rec center kids and kids get swimming lessons - but it’s closed now.

36,"@ToddDykesWLWT @BroadwayCincy I was there today w/ my 8th grader who just read the book &amp; I just taught it. This play, I’d say, takes a ton of liberties and is more “a version” of the book. On it’s own, it’s a powerful comment on being anti racist. Calpurnia is all of us (in sentiment) too!"

45,@becca_costello Isn’t there a program/grant for folks in certain city zip codes to help with the cost?
46,@DouglasWalton99 @fred_guttenberg @CMReggieHarris I know. Your choice. I decided I’d catch up on the housing strategies/notes - it’ll be ongoing. Gun legislation needs to happen - I don’t want school shootings to be ongoing.
47,@DouglasWalton99 @fred_guttenberg I’m aware of that important event which I am sure will be an ongoing discussion. We are fortunate to have leaders like @CMReggieHarris combating the housing crisis in our city.

51,"@khufford0 I cannot with this. So many problems will result. Dead students, dead teachers, teachers quitting. It’s such a lazy, ignorant, and evil Band-Aid non- solution. Good guy with a gun doesn’t help. Passing gun control laws is the only way and those who refuse to help are complicit"
52,This was taken the morning of the day that she was killed and it was her green shoes that helped to identify her. She was so gd shot up that they had to identify her by her shoes! Let that sink in. Do something about it. Demand better. #MarchForOurLivesJune11 https://t.co/LaGCFOWfuB
53,@dlanzillotta Now tell them how much $ said physical violations will cost these families to have done. There are already rules in place in the sports organizations. This is not an issue. No one asked for this. This is abuse and further makes Ohio look like an oppressive idiotville.

I want real leaders that will prevent gun violence not cowards and apologists that enable the next tragedy. I cannot imagine losing my whole class let alone one child! #MarchForOurLivesJune11 https://t.co/fM7TTqd1U9"

63,"My nephew invited us to his graduation party held at his dad’s house in Brown County, Ohio. He earned an Evans Scholarship to The Ohio State University &amp; will probably never return to this place (👍👍). My oldest asked me: who is Brandon? 🙄😓 https://t.co/oklGGa6Sec"

65,@winemedineme Hopefully this will encourage other organizations to NOT hold events in Florida. I’d like to mention that Covid is especially dangerous to some of these athletes - 10X deadlier to folks with DS!
66,"GOP wants high gas prices folks: “The legislation, passed the House 217 to 207,…, with no Republicans supporting it. In the Senate, evenly divided at 50 members in each party, 10 Republicans would need to support it for the bill to pass.”https://t.co/t5mLZbGuUe"

71,@mattmillr @tormntos Republicans are creating a dystopian Wild West! Teachers: be ready to kill but you may get shot b/c cops think you’re the shooter &amp; The “investigation into a shooting at a Thornton Walmart that left three dead was slowed because multiple people drew weapons when shots rang out.”
72,"The Ohio Senate voted 23-9 to pass HB 99 that allows school staff to carry guns with limited training. If this passes, the consequence will be more dead students. Students can wrangle these guns and teachers/staff could shoot kids for perceived threat (think cop situations)"
73,@CincyRadiohead I’ve taught PreK-12 and I love working with elementary kids but I don’t know if I’d love it full time. I really liked the 8th graders this year. Grades 8/9 they still have a childlike wonder and joy but have opinions and deep feelings. I like being there for them.
74,@tscinti Yeah it definitely woke them up! Tomorrow we will look at The Veldt by Ray Bradbury which gives a 1950’s imagining of a future Smart House. Also pretty dark though 😅
75,My first batch of summer school kids (grade 10) just left as I heard one say “I can tolerate this!” 😅😅 That’s actually a success I think. Today we read the short story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson which asks “Should we drop some traditions?!”
