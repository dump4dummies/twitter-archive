79,7/ Bush and Cheney betrayed the American people by lying us into a disastrous war with Iraq. Now the most deceitful president in American history is trying to do it again. I’m running for Congress to help stop him.
80,6/ The justification for this strike was an “imminent threat.” Yet an array of top military and intelligence officials in the Trump administration have debunked this claim. Generals Kelly and Mattis warned us what would happen with no adult supervision in the White House.
81,5/ This is not about national security. Trump is willing to ignite a war that could cost the lives of thousands of American troops and innocent civilians around the world in a cynical attempt to distract from impeachment and become a “wartime president” to boost his re-election.
82,"4/ From the Iranian perspective, Trump’s order to assassinate General Soleimani is their Pearl Harbor and they have vowed retaliation. Further, Iran is not isolated; they recently conducted joint naval exercises with China and Russia. This could become a global conflict."
83,"3/ I had a front-row seat to the disinformation campaign that led us into the Iraq War - the consequences of which are still with us. I’m alarmed that we’re on the brink of repeating our past mistakes, especially with Iran abandoning the nuclear deal today."
84,"2/ Because we’re on the verge of another catastrophic war in the Middle East, I’m trying a restart on Twitter – a platform I left because of its toxicity – to add a personal view on the abuse of power by a dangerous president. Hopefully, Twitter can still be a force for good."
85,1/ An “imminent threat.” Fabricated intelligence that will lead to the loss of American lives.  A cynical attempt to become a “wartime president” to ensure re-election. We’ve seen all of this before.
