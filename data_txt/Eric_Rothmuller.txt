14,"@venenodeneptuno @CaptainKaKow @hasanthehun Even by that logic, are you saying that being referred to as a slave owner / slave whipper isn't an insult? Do you think anyone likes to be called that? Yeah, it's in no way as offensive as the n word but it's definitely a slur and with how it's used, definitely a racial slur."

21,@vodkabooty @HumanistReport Lol
22,@vodkabooty @HumanistReport I'll take that as you don't disagree with anything I said and are simply deflecting. Yes I read the responses to the OP. Obviously my post was a reflection of the responses in this thread. What are you talking about? LOL
23,"@drencourchaine @letitflyely @HumanistReport Thing is, all you see is my skin color and sex and assume all these things about me and come on here and baselessly attack. I can see your heart is in the right place but you've obviously overcorrected so hard that you've become the thing you hate, a sexist and racist."
24,@drencourchaine @letitflyely @HumanistReport You're sure I'm unbothered huh? I ran for U.S. Senate in Kentucky &amp; in my platform was protecting a women's right to choose. I live by the last remaining abortion clinic in Kentucky &amp; have been out there protesting against the religious protesters whom are trying to shut it down.
25,@drencourchaine @letitflyely @HumanistReport That's just a fact. What's me being white have anything to do with it?
26,@APetNamedRobert @HumanistReport Agreed as long as it's not so doomer that it becomes debilitating and unhealthy.
27,"@letitflyely @HumanistReport There's tons of beauty in the world to love. Even in the political realm, there have been massive positive strides in numerous areas over the years to be happy about. Obviously there are still problems but the level of doom &amp; gloom with political people is so high it's unhealthy."
28,"@StanleyRippin @HumanistReport The capitalist class is always going to try to exploit people. A ""decent fucking life"" however is internal &amp; can't be handed to you by any politician. Even if every political agenda you want succeeds, you'll still only have a decent life by going out &amp; achieving it for yourself."
29,@vodkabooty @HumanistReport Who's ignoring things? Just an observation on where politics takes people mentally. Do you disagree with anything I said?
30,"@_MattBoswell @loquatsandmilk @HumanistReport LOL. This is the most out of nowhere ""woke"" Tweet I've seen in a while. No one mentioned these issues and no one said they weren't human rights. What exactly was said that you're addressing with this?"
31,"@loquatsandmilk @HumanistReport I don't disagree with you. Political people have an important role in making positive changes to the world. I'm simply pointing out that political people focus so much of their time on problems, fighting &amp; negative shit that it leads to a really sad mental state for most of them."
32,"@HumanistReport It's sad how the more political people are, the more negative and hopeless people become. You see it oozing out of the responses in this thread and many others like it."

52,"@c_a_nicholas @DaveVescio Remember that non-athiests are the ones proposing the existence of something with no evidence and lack of evidence can be used as proof for atheists whom deny the claims of non-athiests. I think if everyone is being honest though, we're all agnostic since no one really knows üòâ"
53,@c_a_nicholas @DaveVescio It's true that people can choose to refute and not acknowledge anything but I think there's more irrefutable evidence for the non-existence of [insert name of any God humans have come up with] than the other way around.
