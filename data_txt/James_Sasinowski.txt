1,"@jmagnusj I don’t think candidates are the limiting factor. I agree that some seats, including executive seats, should be appointed by legislatures instead of elected by the people as they currently are."

3,"@jmagnusj As you said, I’m concerned with solutions, not labels."
4,@jmagnusj Better voting methods will draw better candidates. I think party focus on the US has shown to be no better about providing solutions than candidate focus.
5,"@jmagnusj Voter empowerment is an important part of election reform. Extended voting periods, voting at home, and state-sponsored candidate info brochures/collections are needed."
6,"@AarikaRhodes This is why voting method reform is so important — we need better government. Problems like war and environmental destruction exist at a scale that only wealthy national governments can address.

19,"@elonmusk @AndrewYang Ranked Choice Voting does *NOT* result in more centrist candidates being elected. Voting methods like #ApprovalVoting and #STARVoting perform much better at electing candidates at the center of public opinion while also being vastly simpler.

https://t.co/XoaSvvDisT"
20,"@DiamondEyesFox @scottsantens Yes, it does.

FairVote’s entire pitch is that RCV allows voters to *feel better* about their vote and helps to ensure the *correct duopoly candidate wins*. They make no claims that RCV breaks duopoly rule. For that, we need methods like #ApprovalVoting and #STARVoting. https://t.co/V6yLtPL98u"

35,"@PunishedLorelai For some, their empathy is high enough and the danger is low enough that it’s worth it. If you don’t feel that’s true for you, then I wouldn’t ask you to have these conversations. My focus is on the distinction between the two concepts in the meme."
36,"@TheHorrorOf97 And that’s a completely valid choice. These conversations are hard, not scalable, and not for everyone. I just believe the distinction between the two ideas in the meme is important to highlight."
37,"@Spyemma1 Someone else pointed out that I should have considered the race of the person in the meme, and they were right. Beyond the completely valid opportunity cost argument, this burden falls primarily on white people."
38,@Krantzstone The opportunity cost argument is a good one. These conversations should not be one’s whole praxis. My focus here is on the distinction that’s often discarded between the two concepts in the meme.

62,"@Tom_Ruen @VotingReformer @BringBackLevity @AndrewYang @Fwd_Party @fairvote Unfortunately, Ranked Choice (Instant Runoff) Voting only pretends to give that level of expression to voters. When you take the time to tally an election, you’ll see that it doesn’t play out that way.

66,"@KrappyKap @5starvoting @sami_baaj In the US, it’s hard to argue that it’s practical beyond 3 winners for any decently proportional candidate-list method. The precincts here are just too small."
67,@jmagnusj @KrappyKap @sami_baaj @5starvoting I recently figured out that 3-winner SPAV could be retain sufficient election security with up to ~11 candidates through summing. I think a proposal where the top 10 petition- gathers make it on the ballot per race is reasonable to attain some degree of proportionality.
68,"@KrappyKap @sami_baaj @5starvoting I once saw a thing that said it was O(N^3), but that doesn’t seem right to me.

PLACE is cool, though."
69,"@sami_baaj There are a bunch of reasons, but maintaining decentralized counting is a dealbreaker for me in a military superpower."
70,"@brianlackey1987 For the US presidential election, I think that makes sense. So many candidates run that it’s likely in everyone’s best interest to use a nonpartisan blanket primary to narrow the field down to the top 5-10 candidates before the general."
71,"@a2e_project The lack of an approval is the opposite of an approval. Some ballot formats have two distinct rows: Approve and Disapprove. Under Approval Voting, a voter can submit a blank ballot for a given race and their vote will actively be counted as disapproving all candidates."
72,"@a2e_project No. Your vote consists of your level of support (and lack thereof) for each candidate. Under our Choose-one, voters are arbitrarily restricted to only being allowed to support up to 1 candidate at a time. Approval Voting simply removes this restriction.
