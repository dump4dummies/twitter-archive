1,"He may rejoice today but we will never join his radical agenda to roll back reproductive rights, voting rights, the rights of LGBTQ+ community, and tribal sovereignty. The reversal of Roe v. Wade is effecting ALL people, and we need you all to get out, use your voice, and vote. https://t.co/D5ZxaIDYEY"
2,"(3/3) In this election, vote for someone who has proven they'll work to protect your rights. I'm Jo Glenn. I'm running for US Senate. I have always, and will always, fight to protect the rights of women. My stance will never change. Vote for me because I will work to protect you."
3,"(2/3) Oklahoma has a primary election on Tuesday for one democratic candidate as US Senator, working to take Senator Lankford's seat. I have the history of activism for women and it will not change.  It comes down to who do you trust to combat this assault on women."
4,(1/3) We knew it was coming but it is still devastating that the Supreme Court could rule that women are now considered incapable of making reproductive decisions. The solution is to vote. VOTE like the lives of all women depend on it because they do.
5,"The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was predictable but heartbreaking. I have been fighting for women's rights for many, many years and promise to continue working alongside many others to protect the rights of women. https://t.co/bUYEAeBSAr"

46,A 3 minute response time by @TulsaPolice at today’s shooting. I am extremely grateful for our first responders here in Tulsa and their bravery shown today and everyday.
47,Is allowing massacres like the one we saw today in Tulsa making Oklahoma the “most pro-life state in the country”? Gov. Stitt and Sen. James Lankford created a safe haven for rampant firearm ownership. Oklahomans are hurt tonight because of it.
48,So did they have too many doors at the Hospital as well? Republicans like James Lankford will use any excuse to avoid taking responsibility for the bloodshed they allow to continue. Hold them accountable.
49,"A week. That’s how long it took since this tweet for a mass shooting to come to Sen. Lankford’s doorstep. Will he stop selling out Tulsans to the NRA or standup to protect his people? No. $18,955. That’s how much 711 Oklahoma lives are worth to him. https://t.co/oP3oI8jKAx"
50,"Additionally, we must implement universal background checks and red flag laws to protect children and victims of domestic violence. Calling for action isn’t enough. We need a Democratic candidate with a plan who will be brave enough to offer solutions, even in a State like ours."
51,"James Lankford and others offer thoughts and prayers tonight. At the end of this month, choose a candidate who will challenge Sen. Lankford on his inaction. I support a Federal assault weapons ban. I refuse to take part in calling for action without actual solutions."
52,"As a lifelong Tulsan, it is extremely painful to see violence in our community at any time, but especially this week. While this is an ongoing situation and we’ll learn more in the coming days, I’m thinking of those injured and the family of those killed this evening. https://t.co/Fq4YS3NW3u"

56,"On May 31st, 1921, Greenwood was hit with devastating attacks on their neighborhoods, homes, and businesses.

63,"@Glorious_Din Mr. Bollinger falsely identified himself as the “only openly gay candidate” running for United States Senate in an attempt to sell more t-shirts for his campaign. As an open member of the LGBT+ community myself, I found this to be extremely troubling and incorrect."

69,More state contracts for our corrupt Governor? 🤔 Yet another example of why healthcare reform must start on the federal level. https://t.co/DEGEcKGhGo
70,"$18,955. That’s how much money my opponent James Lankford has accepted in NRA lobbying money during his time in the Senate. He has stalled gun reform legislation for $18,955. Meanwhile, 711 Oklahomans die each year from gun violence. Those lives are worth more than $18,955."
71,"Roe v. Wade was the battle of my youth. 
We've been here before.
We've seen these attacks before.
We've won before.
We'll win again. 
I'm ready to join a new generation of women as we fight back against oppressive laws like the one recently signed by OK Governor Kevin Stitt."
72,"Governor Stitt's office has said nothing about yesterday's Uvalde shooting. Silence. Today, he signed his so-called ""pro-life"" agenda into law. This law endangers more lives and does nothing to assist these mothers or children once they are born. https://t.co/ARYzuGMVGB"

78,Senator Lankford held a prayer meeting tonight. He has voted against every meaningful piece of gun legislation. A prayer meeting does not bring back the children in Texas and does not protect our children moving forward. Actions speak louder than words. https://t.co/QlT24X8f66
