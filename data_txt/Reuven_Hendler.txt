0,Thank you to all that voted for me. Our campaign succeeded in getting @AndyKimNJ to support Universal Healthcare. It's vital to come together and vote in November to keep the Democratic majority to protect women's rights and fight for access to healthcare for all Americans.

5,"I am running for Congress to serve the people of New Jersey's 3rd district, not corporate interests. 

Unlike my opponent, who receives millions from corporations, I am funded by everyday working-class people. We are relying on grassroots donors like you!

6,"Our Campaign has filed a challenge to Robert Shapiro's ballot petition. Shapiro, a republican candidate for #NJ04, submitted his line as, “Let’s Go Brand*n – FJB”. Profanity directed at the President of the United States is disrespectful to the office."
7,"I'm running for Congress in #NJ03 because Congress has failed at doing its job.

#NJ03 needs a Congressman who supports Medicare for All and acknowledges inflation. Congress must help Americans afford the costs of essential goods.
