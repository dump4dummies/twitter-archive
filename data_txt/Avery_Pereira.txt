5,@digital_bestie @SternFBSuperfan @RepLeeZeldin I like the Giulianis and Trump. I don‚Äôt hate them at all. But I think Zeldin is the best candidate for general and who can lead our state in right direction again.

21,@JosefinaHartle1 Exactly. We were and always will be the party of civil rights
22,"As we observe #Juneteenth today, we reflect on that call in Galveston, TX 157 years ago that slaves were finally free. It was a day that sparked a new era of freedom and equality in our nation. We have made the most progress than any country in the history of the world."

36,@SarahPalinUSA Congrats @SarahPalinUSA I know you‚Äôll make a wonderful congresswoman. It will bring so much hope to many if you pull this off in August.
37,I hope all of you had a nice weekend with your loved ones. I want to thank all of you for your prayers as I struggled through Covid the past few days. I have been feeling much better. Ivermectin has been a life saving medication. I thank God for this recovery. Stay safe everyone.
38,@GiriWaltz Really? Is that why Ivermectin is helping so many people? I started taking it two days ago and I‚Äôm feeling much better. Like I didn‚Äôt have Covid to begin with.
39,@Carmeli07652649 Some doctors are able to prescribe it
40,@CoryMillsFL He wouldn‚Äôt even be hired
41,@s_considine1 It puzzles me why he would recommend us to get the vaccine and he said he got it. I guess because he helped to launch operation warp speed
42,@StacyK_dance4me @RepSwalwell That is a very nice thing to say to someone who is suffering with Covid now
43,"@DrAdamAneevit I had to get vaccinated last year for my job. Didn‚Äôt want to, but had no choice. Had to work to support myself and family. I usually get sick in summer, but just got Covid first time two days ago. Feeling better after taking Ivermectin. I said no thank you to Paxlovid."
44,"- Market üìâ 900 points today
- 85 million on Medicaid
- 42 million on food stamps
- Inflation at 8.6%
- ‚õΩÔ∏è prices over $5/gallon
- Over $30 trillion in debt 
- Over $4 trillion spent by feds in a year
- Interest rates doubled 

This is an economic crisis under Biden‚Äôs leadership."
45,@nanacook69 @RepSwalwell That bill would do nothing to decrease cost of gas. Just because it says gas price gouging bill doesn‚Äôt mean it would actually help. Tell the admistration to drill for oil here to create jobs and decease costs. Instead he listens to extremists
46,"@RepSwalwell What constructive thing have you done for your district and the country? Nothing but to drill our nation down the tube. Millions are paying more for gas, groceries, and other products. Yet you‚Äôre silent on that. Disgraceful"
47,"@GovKathyHochul Btw, when are you going to investigate the thousands of deaths in nursing homes during height of pandemic? Where is the justice for the families of loved ones? You are a disgrace to our state."
48,@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP Why are you even following me? Are you spying on me or should that be the job of your mistress?
49,@PassannanteJon What a horrible tragedy. Byrd should be prosecuted. This was murder. Ashli Babbit deserves justice.
50,"Never forget the thousands of Covid positive seniors that died in nursing homes, many others were injured or died in Covid related illness. Yet there is little accountability. We need Justice for those we lost and their loved ones."
51,"@GovKathyHochul You should be ashamed of yourself to regulate life saving treatment for those of us struggling with Covid. You and your elitist friends have all the access to everything you need, but us on the bottom have to go through hurdles. You have no shame."
52,"Dr. Fauci should be in jail for his reckless and inexcusable actions. And the Chinese government, along with this administration, should be held accountable for the Covid destruction they put on our country for over two years."
53,"Thousands of innocent Americans had life saving treatment withheld from them, resulting in many unnecessary injuries and deaths. Those in power responsible for this senseless and horrific act against humanity should be imprisoned. There needs to be accountability."
54,If you test positive for #COVID19 contact doctors immediately that will prescribe the real life saving drugs such as Ivermectin and HCQ. Or find facility that will give monoclonal antibody treatment. Don‚Äôt let government and Big Pharma stand in way of life saving treatment.
55,"This is horrific. The crime on our streets is increasing by the day. We need our leaders to step up and fix our broken system to protect our communities. We need to repeal bail reform and keep hard core criminals in jail.

56,"Just awful. May God Bless these brave Marines and their loved ones during this difficult time. 
https://t.co/2JFCS6RClf"

62,"@SpeakerPelosi Then why don‚Äôt you and the president do something about it? It‚Äôs the massive spending you, other congressional democrats, and the president have contributed to the country that has resulted in record high gas prices and inflation. Stop putting the blame on Putin and companies."
63,@GavinWax @NYYRC Great job guys! Thank you for working hard to register voters. I wish the leadership in our local parties took the time and made an effort to register new voters.

72,"President Biden‚Äôs speech last night is a reminder that our rights are under attack and that the Far Left agenda is destroying the foundation of our republic. The Bill of Rights, including #2A are fundamental rights that come from God and can never be taken away by government."
73,"I proudly endorse @FrankPallottaNJ for Congress. Frank will stand up for our constitutional rights and fight hard against the Far Left‚Äôs radical agenda. We need his voice in Washington to stand up for our benefits, not the benefits of DC elitists. Vote this Tuesday NJ-5!"

77,"After careful consideration, I will not be a candidate for State Senate in  D-26. With the new maps and primary in three months, there‚Äôs not enough time to put together a campaign team. I hope @KingsCountyGOP will pick someone to run against Gounardes."
