10,Happy Birthday @realDonaldTrump . When you're in Oklahoma on the 20th you're invited to my homemade ice cream meet and greet. 39900 Hazel Dell Rd in Shawnee. Michael Ballard for Congress.
11,"As American citizens we have the right to peacefully protest. We don't have the right to loot, attack people, set fires, block streets and act worse than animals. It's past time to take back our country."
12,"If you value Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness then vote for Michael Ballard. https://t.co/sx4WUEavoH"
13,"All gave some and some gave all. May we never forget our fallen heroes. Freedom isn't free, it was paid for in blood."
14,"The government should not pick winners and losers in the business world, it should be up to the consumer."
15,Planned parenthood recieved 80 million in aid for the virus. This is an outrage. When I am in Congress I will never vote to give anything to the killing factory.
16,Today is Armed Forces Day. May GOD bless each and everyone of them.
17,"Today is Good Friday. Jesus said if we deny him to the world, he would deny us to his HOLY FATHER! He is Risen!"
18,"Something to think about. Thieving and power hungry politicians are arresting honest Americans and releasing criminals, all in the name of keeping us safe. Remember this when you go vote."
19,Since some elected officials are issuing orders to stay home to save lives. I call on them to issue a order to stop abortions. That would save more lives.
20,Today is Medal Of Honor Day. Thank GOD for these heroes!

22,"@Dingus_Khann @DavidHillOK @CongressLandon @miles4ok5 @JanetBarresiOK @MeridethVansant @stephaniebice @NeeseForOK5 For one thing, they should not be adding a bunch of worthless pork spending to the bills that are supposed to help those affected by the virus. The government should also remove a lot of red tape and let the private sector help as well as non profit organizations."
23,"To everyone that keeps saying President Trump is still impeached, guess what he is still your president. Lol"
24,"Well sleepy Joe put his rat claws on a guy, cussed him, told a lady to shut up, and when the guy told him he would work for us senile Joe said he wouldn't work for us. What a moron!"
25,In the Army I lived by the code of DUTY Honor Country and I will live by that code in Congress.

27,"I hear rinos on the campaign trail say that they will reach across party lines and compromise. I will never compromise with a bunch of socialist, that want to destroy our country."
28,"So let me get this straight... the socialist party that wants to control everything, can't even run their own caucus."

32,It's beyond disgusting that the fake news is comparing the death of a terrorist to Elvis and Princess Diana. And they wonder why we call them fake news.
33,It's a sad day when every socialist in our country is supporting Iran and other terrorist groups.
34,"Nancy Pelosi has said she wants President Trump to give the entire Congress a full briefing on Iran. Give me a break, there is so many traitors in Congress. They would sell us out in a heartbeat."
35,@IlhanMN I'm sorry one of your friends was killed.
36,Wishing everyone a safe and Happy New Year. Don't forget our troops in harms way and the first responders.
37,Is there any part of the Bill Of Rights or Bible that the socialist like?

45,During the socialist debate last night they were talking about it wasn't enough to go after and get rid of President Trump. They were wanting to do the same to all of his supporters. Talk about sick and twisted.
46,"As a combat veteran, I applaud President Trump for pardoning the two army officers and restoring the rank of the navy seal. We should not be sending our troops to prison for fighting during a battle."
47,I have never received a job from a poor person or a struggling company.  Every time taxes are raised and regulations are added it hurts the economy.
48,I would like to wish everyone that has worn the uniform a Happy Veterans Day .
49,Happy Birthday to The United States Marine Corps.
50,"I would rather have a President that gets results that don't act traditional, than have a traditional President that doesn't get results."
