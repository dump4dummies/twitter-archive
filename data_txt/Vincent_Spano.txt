3,"Today is Election Day! When you head to the polls remember who the true conservative in this race is- the one backed by the NRA, National Right to Life, and Florida Right to Life. Vote Ross Spano for Congress! 🇺🇸"
4,".@mattgaetz you’re lying to the voters of FL15 when you say I don’t support the President &amp; the Border Wall. YOU voted No on that bill the same way I did, because it gave the President only a fraction of the $ needed &amp; it tied his hands on how &amp; where he could build it. #OMG https://t.co/cclARDQVIG"
5,"As the ONLY candidate in this race endorsed by the NRA, I will always protect your right to bear arms. https://t.co/8jhjC64Cpz"

12,Pelosi and the DCCC just accused me of being conservative and against abortion. Correct. 👍🏼 https://t.co/DOs6x9shmW

19,This campaign is about #PeopleNotPolitics — and for good reason. Speaker Pelosi cannot say the same. Her willingness to take a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and turn its response into one of scoring long-term political points will forever be a stain on this nation’s response to #COVIDー19. https://t.co/1KyALH9RAQ
20,@AlanMCohn @UFCW (2/2) understand their needs and coordinate efforts. Try again.
21,"@AlanMCohn @UFCW (1/2) I can’t thank the medical professionals represented by @UFCW enough. Which is why while you were out campaigning and filming these videos I was out talking directly to the medical professionals, first responders, and elected officials at all levels of government to"

35,End elective abortion. Ironic isn’t it? #ForTheChildren #SpeakerPelosi
36,Speaker Pelosi wants to “end run” members of the #USHouse and prosecute #AGBarr in civil court without a vote of the full body. So much for “regular order”.  #Unprecedented
37,#HouseDemocratics just voted to 1) block law enforcement from accessing gang member database 2) give amnesty to violent criminals 3) provide $35M in unpaid mandatory spending and 4) offer $0 for border security. #insanity
38,#HouseDemocrats just refused to support Israel by voting no on anti-BDS amendment to HR1994. #HouseDemocrats headed in the wrong direction.
39,"This is the counter to the politics of envy so prevalent today.

45,@IrreverentView @MarcACaputo @DavidJollyFL Enjoyed it Chris! Thanks for having me.
46,@Thelightsareon1 This is an absolute fraud piece. It’s an intentional and inaccurate misrepresentation of my position on these issues. These folks never even reached out to me to ask my position.

86,"@HvinAMorganMomt @CivilGunOwner It certainly seems your (of course not mine) opinion means something to you, or you wouldn’t have waisted all this time trying to convince me you’re right."
87,"@HvinAMorganMomt State lawmakers can, have, and will continue to chip away at the 2nd A if allowed. Our point of contention was not whether it exists (for now), but the extent to which freedom loving Americans will permit their rights to be eroded by those who do not think it should exists."
88,"@HvinAMorganMomt No, the initial conversation was about my unashamed support of the 2nd A.  You responded by saying I was acting like the 2nd A is under attack, which it surely is.  You then asserted there’s nothing lawmakers can do to threaten it, and I called BS.  They certainly can."
89,"@HvinAMorganMomt @JViscoNJ That’s absolutely wrong.  State lawmakers can pass laws significantly limiting the 2nd Amendment, see NY, CA, IL, MD, MA."
