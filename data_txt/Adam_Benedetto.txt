9,"@wisgop If ""Highly Partisan"" is a problem I suggest you think about how Trump treated blue states and red states differently. Or, look at how the GOP in Wisconsin acts about any issue. Literally any issue."
10,Babies being bombed in Ukraine reminds me that we still need to ban guns in America. No kids should be dying due to war or gun violence.
11,@ShuForCongress While trump doesn't know how to shake hands he literally got impeached for withholding arms from Ukraine. I'm sorry you're so confused on this topic.
12,@wispolitics But it's not a win for the Dems. It's still gerrymandered the way it was for the past 10 years. It just didn't get worse. Evers was restricted and they didn't use the non-partisan maps that were drawn up. It's not a win at all.  A minority of the population is still in charge.
