35,We cannot let colorism go unchecked. We cannot let any form of discrimination go unchallenged. We cannot stop this fight until we've won.
36,"And it's in our politics. 

Having dark skin is a political liability. It's used to make dark skinned candidates look threatening, untrustworthy. It's weaponized against candidates of color every cycle, by Reps &amp; Dems, white candidates &amp; candidates of color.

It must end."
37,"Just like institutionalized racism, colorism is systemic. Every year, billions of dollars worldwide are spent on skin lightening and bleaching creams. In movies, from Birth of a Nation to Indiana Jones, the villains have darker skin than the heroes.

Colorism is everywhere."
38,"Colorism is a byproduct of racism, slavery, of colonialism, and of imperialism. It is not just a weapon wielded by white people, but is often used within communities of color because we've also internalized the idea that light skin is better than dark."
39,"Over the course of the last day, we have gotten a lot of questions from supporters asking about why @RepYvetteClarke would send a mail piece with racial overtones. 

It's a hard conversation, but an important one. And it's one I want to share with you all here.

What is colorism?"

79,"There is no way I would compromise my values and lived experiences over money, hence why I sacrificed the opportunities I could‚Äôve had to help my family financially, and chose a life of public service."
80,"To be clear: I have not, nor will I ever, accept money from the PBA, the SBA, or from the defense contractors that put weapons of war into the hands of police officers. However, the same can't be said of my opponents."
81,"And yet, some of my opponents' supporters would rather ignore my identity and my experiences as a Black man born and raised in NYC  - although that‚Äôs the opposite of what this movement they allegedly support is all about."
82,I could go on. The issues of police brutality and systemic racism are deeply personal to me. I‚Äôve lived them and dedicated my life to helping those who have been impacted by both in Central BK. I‚Äôm not just pontificating.
