So it must be done from an office that gets coverage.  It can't just be a pretty speech, it has to be done with the people that need the help."

The biggest difficulty with our government is

46,"@SonnieJohnson First, the Senator is supposed to work with their States' and Counties' Governments to localize the resources and reasons for limits on zoning priorities.  Most local zoning authorities have 2 objectives, resource/utility management and property values."
