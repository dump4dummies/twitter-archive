1,"@canadavsengland @shall_inf11 @happycrazytown @FoxNews 21+ for a tubal litigation, not restrictions and no need for medical cause. 
18-35 for a hysterectomy but they prefer this method only if there is a medical condition. 
Both can cause a woman regret if they change their minds later to have a child."
2,"Oh I love this image, it reminds me of all the Abortions that took place. Can I hold the stop killing our kids poster at the next abortion protest? https://t.co/Gho34yD7gA"
3,@kelly_canton @Zetetic_News @NC_Governor Let me correct my last post. Cooper “only” commented on it. And basically “if” the state house and senate voted for banning abortions.
4,"@kelly_canton @Zetetic_News @NC_Governor No but a condom or abstinence can prevent giving you that child. While we can agree to disagree, Cooper on commented to beg for votes in his next election. 
Basically is the state house and senate vote on this, he is just saying he is going to veto it. That’s a dictator move."
5,@sherrilehde @FoxNews I never said anything about him needing protection.
6,"@Jessie47498428 @FoxNews No, let her run, watch her lose. She can’t even handle the VP job that well."
7,"@FoxNews They keep making a big deal of it, wasn’t that much of a threat on 1/6 because it cleared out by 5/6 pm and they were back in chambers by 8:3 to continue."
8,"@FoxNews Well there goes a waste of tax dollars again. They love living their life with threats against them. They keep doing it to themselves. Fuck it’s been 2 years already, let it go. 
You only need security when you know you’re about to do some shady shit and don’t want to be caught."
9,"@UmbralPrince @BackthenFoward @KurtSchlichter The fact that they were jumping in his vehicle, nah he could have took off. The only thing he’d have to do is live with his choice. 

Their actions can and would be perceived as a threat on his life. 

The Charlottesville tragedy was a planned attack. You can not compare the two."
10,@hrc55 @NC_Governor Are we talking about compensation for everyone or just a specific demographic? I can agree with some but not all of what you’ve mentioned. I’m not getting into specific because you seem extremely irritated but and honestly don’t see you being be down for a civil conversation.
11,"@hrc55 @NC_Governor I’m not trying to start anything but I’m just curious, who is going to cash those checks? Surely the descendants can’t cash it, and even if they could, a years wage at that time and rate would be no more than maybe 200.00 yearly max and that’s giving them more that a corporal."
12,"@Genohcyde To control trade and people. Incentivize a person with a way to make that money or credit and you’ll have a worker too. Which is why right now, people are lazy because there’s no reason to work if the government gives you money. They do that to control votes."
13,"@lou_nautic @FoxNews My apologies, I had to look into it. I wasn't aware that what I know as the Arson Task Force was a part of the Federal ATF. Makes sense now. I was always under the assumption that they were separate entities."
14,@FoxNews Routine fire? Why is the ATF in the picture.
15,"@NathanAArcher @BruisersBurner @FoxNews You’re the dumbass I talked about in another post. As you work in life, you pay into that SS. The ones taking from your SS are the one sitting around doing nothing, collecting from the government right now. The same ones that choose not to work but demand free money."
16,"@comeonbru @BolashSteve @FoxNews I can almost promise you, if I offered a free iPhone to everyone that voted Republican and can prove to me they did that, they would do it just for that free phone. 

Look what they did for free money that was denied by Dems until Biden got in office. They used that as leverage."
17,"@comeonbru @BolashSteve @FoxNews Lmao, they had primitive forms of technology back then. They also had this thing called a newspaper. This was something world wide. Folks were smarter back then than they are today. At least they knew what to look out for. Today they don’t give a shit unless it’s free or new."
18,"@FoxNews So not mature enough to own a gun but mature enough to vote. That’s gonna play out real well. 
I’m half tempted to say just let them have their way and watch this nation crumble. But I’ll have some dumbass on here saying that’ll never happen."
19,"@Michell74996286 @LibRishJibRish @JoeCiti67753967 @ksorbs That looks bad but I wouldn’t be surprised about the damage, especially coming from a weapon that fires a bullet in similar size to a 22. Just a little bit longer and more powder. 

What’s messed up is that even with a CT Scan, you don’t get images like that."
20,@DrEvans1784 @RiversRios14 @greg_price11 Either you have 0 knowledge on money. Or you have everyone buying things for you to think that an EV car is all they'll be paying for.
21,"@DrEvans1784 @RiversRios14 @greg_price11 Even with perfect credit, the average worker, couldn't afford that car. Once the gas is gone, they will raise the rates on electricity. 
Right now, the average person is left with maybe 400 a month after all their bills are paid and food is bought."
22,@Genohcyde Sounds about right.
23,@Genohcyde @elonmusk That might not be a great idea. You’ll have a lot of people in trouble.
24,"@BANGenergy Sponsor? Wow, people are cheap these days. Bang is worth the buck at the store. I’m good, I rather support great companies."
25,@DavilleTV Only downfall of private schools I can see is that the rich kids will be the bullies.
26,"@DavilleTV I’m proud of you man, finally going back to school."
27,"@Susank505 That’s a matter of your opinion. 
Did he hurt your feelings?"
28,"@Susank505 Originally I thought that was the article you were talking about but then I thought to myself, maybe she was smart enough to verify that article. Given only 1 source has the story, Vanity fair has always been known for gossip and we all know gossip is lies that keep getting spun."
29,"@Susank505 So you share and article from Business insider that shared an article from 1990’s Vanity Fair, which was questioned in 2015 and information was found to be a verbal assault on him at the time of their divorce. That the book in question was not what the article listed."
30,@DavilleTV Is that what you’re calling it lol.
31,"@Susank505 Do you have any documented proof? I’m not saying you are wrong but I don’t know you or where your information is from. 

That’s like me coming to you saying Jill and Hunter said Joe was in love with Obama. Unless I had an actual source, video or phone call, my facts are false."
32,"@TBanditcool Guns are the simple tool of the weak. Something they don’t have to work for. But guns are more than a weapon of destruction, it is a tool. 

A tool that servers many purposes."
33,"@TBanditcool Except in 2018 where there was a shooting that killed 5 and injured 11. Report via BBC. It’s going to happen, people have guns, it’s not a Gun issue. It’s a mental health issue. Until we can effectively take care of the mental issues, the problem will not be fixed."
34,"@Susank505 I’m curious to know where you heard this information. 

I searched for this information and even sites that hated trump even defended him and threw those claims out. Hell even fact checkers like Snopes called the claim False. https://t.co/yyCqaWhElo"
35,"@BrenBedosky @DermaFaire @MrAndyNgo Talk about getting roasted by the replies, you sir are extra crispy right now."
36,"@jesse4685 @w_terrence The vaccine was just released by the fda when he took office, hardly a comparison. That’s not an achievement, especially when he rode on the wave from Trump administration."
37,"@jesse4685 @w_terrence You really think diversity holds the best interest of this nation.  That’s why we are failing. 

Diversity is great, don’t get me wrong about that. But in the best interest of this nation, we need people that are capable of handling things."
38,"@FoxNews Also, a rifle starts out about 550/600, building in may cost more but you’ll get something that’s better for personal defense. And I don’t know about anyone else but I’m not taking my “Guard” dog to the grocery store. Gun laws are just as dumb as some of the anti gun owners."
39,"@FoxNews Let’s see, get a dog? Okay now I have to train the dog and pray he doesn’t turn on my family. I’m looking at almost 1k for decent training, that doesn’t including the price of the dog. 

Barking doesn’t defend a home. Now the sound a rifle racking a round, that works better."
40,https://t.co/BwpEbBz5hc
41,"There are no words for this attack. I just have a question, why was she working alone? And did they catch this guy? https://t.co/CdZho7QJhz"
42,@BANGenergy Addicts
43,"@CWDandAJD @MrAndyNgo That’s the officers gun, look closely after the gun is in the ground and you can see his holster is empty. I’d be pissed if they say it’s hers. 
I am not in her side but I doubt she had a gun on her."
44,"@BANGenergy Okay Wendy’s. We get it, you drank to many. It’s okay, have a Snickers and you’ll be yourself again."
45,"@CellaMarie2 @RepMattGaetz It’s just like all the COVID bullshit. The information was literally there, every press release, every phone call, every trip. All public information posted to a government “official” site and you still believe the stuff CNN put out. 

Which CNN got caught lying afterwards."
46,"@CellaMarie2 @RepMattGaetz And that was the peoples decision to attempt that. Nothing in any speech said to overthrow the government. Everything was hearsay. 

It doesn’t matter what I say to be honest. Based on zero facts and only your opinion by what you were fed, you’ll find him guilty either way."
47,"@curiouslywrittn @RepMattGaetz And that is a matter of opinion. I could say the same about Biden or even better both Clinton’s, Obama and Bush. But that would be my opinion."
48,"@CellaMarie2 @RepMattGaetz That’s a matter of opinion. Even after he left office, they’ve found most of the info they had was false but hey you hate him, you won’t believe anything else. 

Senate didn’t find enough credible evidence both time to fully impeach him. So there’s that."
49,"@RepMattGaetz Also it doesn't help that the committee is bias against Trump. Each person on the committee voted for Trumps second impeachment. It's bullshit like that, the reason DHS released the Advisory notice to the public of upcoming threats. Congress is causing it."
50,"@RepMattGaetz I find the committee unfair, panel of 9 made up of 7 Democrats and 2 Republicans, 1 Dem that is known to make shit up and 3 of them are from the same state. Why couldn't they make it somewhat fair, you can have 4 Dems, 4 Rep with 1 Independent, 1 from each state."
51,@C1985Bears @RepMattGaetz And yet they have 1 person on the committee that makes shit up all the time.
52,@Susank505 @FoxNews It’s easy to say more people are employed when have less positions to fill.
53,"@FoxNews Please explain the logic how Biden saved the economy and spare me the it has to get worse before it gets better bullshit. 

4.50+ for gas, food shortages, and price spike. 
Jobs a running away to China again.  Who’s he helping, America or China? Are they looking at Chinas number?"
54,"@mobilesales @elonmusk @mlakan @EpochTimes @BillGates Gates has been a computer programmer all his life, what does he truly know about science. He knows software, and to be honest, I don’t think he really knows much. The man has been a leach on others work for decades."
55,"@ChadwickVonApe @RobSchneider Fact check, if they have to fact check it for you, then they’re likely hiding something. There’s some truth to this, just unless you are there, you will never know. You just have to take the word of a “Fact Checker” who used to work for the same news sources to make up lies."
56,"@kcjones92399 @FoxNews Hmm that’s funny, Fox News isn’t the only one talking about this. Your buddies at CNN are just not putting health on the front page due to new regulations to try and get ratings back up. 

https://t.co/JVsZ5hcdIV"
57,"I’m sharing this from a friend. This is why you will not take my guns. 

You can fact check this all you want. But we know for a fact 1938 is true. I’m almost certain the rest is accurate. #noguncontrol #2ndAmendment shall remain. https://t.co/HsVIOtqxaJ"
58,"@Blackdove50 @Jim_Jordan Let's ban the fork for making us fat, Let's ban the knife because that's next assault weapon. Let's ban the air, because its racists and only clean in certain area. Let's ban the 1st amendment because the words you spoke are offensive. Have fun with banning shit."
59,"@Blackdove50 @Jim_Jordan Yeah, let military and law enforcement be the only ones to carry. That's a smart move, let's trust the government. The government has our best interest. 

Yet the government won't bail us out when we are financially hurting, they won't get our homeless off the streets."
60,"@MadeInTheUSANJ @RepMTG @davidhogg111 You say don’t agree with war yet you want to go after the 2nd greatest power in the world. Keep reading your banned books, maybe one of them will teach you something. Going after Putin will not only start a war, but will put more Americans in danger."
61,"What concerns me is that 6 days prior to Uvaulde. Congress voted on HR350, authorizing the FBI to have a dedicated domestic terrorism task force. Pretty much the Secret Police."
62,"Let’s talk about this #babyformula bill. Did you know, even tho it was voted on, it did nothing for the babies. It only appropriated 28M to the FDA for salaries and expenses. 
So they can send agents to the field to find out why and I guess to prevent another shortage."
63,Well there ya have it folks. Guns kill more kids in American than #Abortion does.
64,"@sebastiansteber @GlennJacobsTN Lol. Since 1791 only 1 amendment was repealed and that took place in 1933 repealing prohibition of alcohol or 1919. 

They can’t touch the second and if they tried, they’d start a war."
65,"If all state become red flag state, I foresee surprise overnight laws being introduced making everyone a target to this. We can not let congress trample over our gun rights. The government has already shown us that they don't care about us."
66,"@MadeInTheUSANJ @Jim_Jordan Raise your hands if you want your freedom of speech take.  It’s funny, seeing how we want new gun laws but what did the New Black Panther Party walk around with in GA then threaten motorist asking questions. Wait for it…"
67,"@denise76300 @bebe1969 Also your profile says you’re a proud democrat. You must be a proud clan member then. It was the Democrats that started the KKK in 12/24/1865. So tell me, how proud of a democrat are you."
68,@denise76300 @bebe1969 Before you waive that American flag around. The militias of the time the constitution was written were farmers and shop owners. Militias made up of the people to defend the people from tyrannical governments.
69,"@denise76300 @bebe1969 And that’s where you’re wrong. There’s a reason there’s commas in the passage. 
And why the amendment doesn’t speak of muskets. 

To take up arms is to equip yourself with the weapons of the time. Which at this time would be anything in the range of 5.56 or 7.62."
70,"@JoeCiti67753967 @Mohawker777 @RepMattGaetz You’re right we did, but it won’t happen with the 2nd. The first 10 will never be touched. You can’t compare the 21st and 18th to any of the first ten. 

Take away the peoples rights to defend themselves, you just empowered the government. Right now the power is balanced."
71,@JoeCiti67753967 @Mohawker777 @RepMattGaetz The amendment term is from changes made over time. They amended to the bill.  You can add but not remove. That’s the way the document was written. Shall not be infringed was written to make the 2nd finalize or in Biden’s terms “Absolute”.
72,"@bebe1969 @boredpanda Yet again, Dems have the wonderful way of blocking people when they don’t agree with you. https://t.co/958r5o25aY"
73,"@denise76300 @bebe1969 Gouging is done at the pumps, not at the source. Sure that can go down but it’s not going to stop the pumps. 

Next Gun reform, hmm what part of Shall not be infringed. 

Looks like y’all drank the Biden koolaid. The 2nd amendment is absolute and can not be changed."
74,"@denise76300 @bebe1969 Baby formula was 2 votes, 1st vote Republicans said yes and Dems said no, 15 minutes later something changed, Dems said yes republicans said no. So point out both facts. 

Next I can’t say for sure on the oil company gouging. But it won’t fix anything."
75,@denise76300 @bebe1969 Just like Dems want it to think it’s all republicans fault. Works both ways.
76,@bebe1969 @boredpanda But I’m sure as long as you get your small cut of the pie you’re happy. How were those stimulus checks for ya. You know the little bit of money you got while a non-American country got the majority.  The country got it but the people of said countries received nothing from it.
77,@bebe1969 I came here because of a @boredpanda article of a tweet you made. Now I see why you would question found money in a book. You claim republicans vote against helping Americans and yet fail to see all the bills they vote against go to helping other countries or helping the rich.
78,@FoxNews She was proved to be lying and she still thinks this is a setback. What was she hoping for? How can we move forward as a society if you expect to be taken serious by lying.
79,@BANGenergy Don’t tempt me with a good time.
80,"@aaronkollar @rdwoodward @WilbournGeoff @NC_Governor @markrobinsonNC Correct, different breeds but those border patrol agents most likely served in all branches. So how different are they?"
81,"@rdwoodward @JamesShoresNC @NC_Governor @markrobinsonNC The DOI was drawn up a reason why we separated from England. The Constitution was written to ensure we stay free. The issues that led up to WW2 in Germany shown why we can’t let them take away our rights. 

Take away the 2nd, they will come for your 1st. Then the rest is history."
82,"@BillSchech @bigjabird @NC_Governor @markrobinsonNC Yet!  You forgot to add that part. Trusting the government 100% is going to be your fault. 

We get it, you’re compliant. You’re a good lil boy to the system."
83,@hodgetwins I have this happen all the time. Most of the time I just ignore those I don't agree with. Keep them around for the comedy.
84,"@NkerTh3 @jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 Oh sorry, I read your location incorrect, you're still an idiot. Fuck off with your lets take guns away. You're not even from America, why the fuck are you involving yourself in shit that happen over here."
85,"@Genohcyde Damn, kinda harsh there lol"
86,"@NkerTh3 @jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 But hey you’re from Germany, you should already know this from history. Especially over the course of 20 years with Hitler slowly taking over. Small things like, removing the guns from the people, then separation by racial divide. Learn your history or you’ll repeat it."
87,"@NkerTh3 @jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 You call yourself a thinker but you don’t think for shit. 

If the use of a firearm is needed then yes but only if that need arises. 

You don’t fight a tyrannical government with knives, you will lose. 

If you can’t see a bigger picture and only care to twist shit, you lose."
88,"@jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 Y’all gotta stop comparing America to other countries. Those countries claim to be free but look what happen with the lock downs over COVID, no one was free, they had no means to fight back."
89,"@OiOldboy @jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 Doesn’t matter what was created when the constitution was written. The language is universal to time. So 100 years from now when we have weapons that shoot energy, the people have the right to obtain those as well. Want to change that write a new declaration of war."
90,"@Coder__godson_ @Twitter @TwitterSafety @votesamuelwill1 Why would I message anyone other than Twitter. It's their service. I'm sure is Sam Williams wanted his account back, he would have already contacted them. It's not my account to take back."
91,@guy_phish @MisterMarcG @piersplowman316 @nypost That's what I get from getting my info from CNN. They said it happen from 2009-2011. I just assumed it happen under Obama. Google says it started in 2006. But lets face it. It's a buyback program.
92,"@guy_phish @MisterMarcG @piersplowman316 @nypost Damn you're right, my bad. Okay Bush did it."
93,"@jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 Give a man or woman a little power and they’ll only demand more. Take away the thing that limits that power and you leave the people defenseless. This is the main reason we are not like NK, China or countries that have dictators."
94,"@jake_hansen_ @elonmusk @AJDelgado13 You don’t know the reason the constitution was written or are you that secure that you think the government will never turn on its people. 

It was written to assure that the people have access to the same weaponry as the government to protect our freedoms."
95,@realjamesowen Cartels?
96,".@elonmusk can give each American 2 Million each, this includes the babies. Write it off as charitable donation and it wouldn’t hurt his pockets. 

Just saying it would be a friends gesture."
97,@MisterMarcG @guy_phish @piersplowman316 @nypost Hell it’s a buy back program then. Obama gave them the guns in the first place. Operation Fast and Furious.
98,@elonmusk I’ll raise the stats on the don’t trust billionaires part if .@Elonmusk let’s me have 1 million.
99,"@guy_phish @piersplowman316 @nypost Nope not a gun problem. Killers can pick knives and still do a lot of damage. 

Look at places like Chicago and New York. These cities have a zero gun policy. Stands against the constitution but that’s besides the point. Criminals will still get guns even if we made them illegal."
