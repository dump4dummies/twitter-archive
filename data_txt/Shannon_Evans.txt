1,@bloodyhailmary @POTUS More deaths under Biden than under Trump. Thats better???
2,@CanadianBadBoys @BermudaGirl4 @mynameissquatch @AngelaBelcamino @POTUS I understand that if you cut production when ppl are staering to drive that raises the price more. You cut that means less. Less to go around. Higher price. Biden has cut production. Tell me tou don't understand how the presidents policies cause fluctuations in different markets
3,@BermudaGirl4 @mynameissquatch @AngelaBelcamino @POTUS Bull. We was energy independent under trump. We wouldn't have 6 dollar a gallon has under trump.
4,"Why is it that when someone goes through and shoots kids the Democrats say they care, but when a doctor kills more kids every year they say keep doing it? Why is it that they say keep giving women drugs that will kill their child and thats ok, but shooting 19 ppl needs gun contr"
5,@MelonHusk71 @nypost They didn't say that was the .38 The .38 was the one thrown away. That's one of the many problems with your comment.
6,@blackskymonkey @kaybeebs88 @realRichHunting @Mike_Pence Do you have proof that Richard wanted to lynch Pence??? I didn't want to lynch Pence and I wish he would have ran last time. I would have voted for him and I know a lot of other ppl that would. Run Pence Run.
7,@Jdleo1800 @POTUS Show the proof
8,@nypost What happened to #MyBodyMyChoice ??? 16 is the age of consent in PA. If you agree or not with that that is the law. It's only because she is a teacher.
9,@RobertJSpradlin @thePnerd @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton That denial is denying a man the right to insert his bodily fluids into your body.
10,@TIME They won't. It will be do I have unprotected sex or not.
11,"@RobertJSpradlin @thePnerd @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton Wrong. I will say it again ask Scott Peterson. He was found guilty of killing his unborn son. He was convicted of murdering a human, a baby, unborn."
12,@RobertJSpradlin @thePnerd @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton Wrong. Ask Scott Peterson. Everyone was happy he was found guilty of murder for killing unborn child. You can't murder a nonhuman thing or item. Murder is ending a life of a human.
13,@RobertJSpradlin @thePnerd @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton Tell Scott Peterson that. He was convicted of killing his baby before he was born. It is a baby.
14,"@RobertJSpradlin @thePnerd @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton I disagree. Read the guilty verdict for Scott Peterson about what Ca called his baby and found him guilty of murder. He just performed an abortion. He killed an unborn thing according to you. So there is ""law"" that says unborn is a human and a baby. You can't murder nonhuman"
15,@AlfredS99325985 @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton What about a man's reproductive rights??? Oh wait he has none.
16,@RobertJSpradlin @MamaKnowsZilch @GopSux2 @HillaryClinton Right to privacy??? Why is it private for a women to kill a man's child??? Can a man then turn around and kill one of her kids and walk away without jail time? No he can't. He would get life in prison. Conor Peterson proved babies are humans thats how Scott got the death penalty
17,"@HillaryClinton The latest polls show 54% says abortion should be legal not 70%. Human rights is a babies rights as well. That baby is growing inside a women, but it's still a human. So where is the rights for the baby??? More black ppl have abortions than others. Why kill the next mlk jr???"
18,@WaynePeacock @KeithTatem @RWPUSA So you are ok with the Republicans having complete control with no checks in the senate come November??? You would cry foul everytime they passed a bill and call for the filibuster Rule. Can't have it both ways.
19,@SusanWade1999 @LucilleTafleur @RWPUSA Would you before a law that says if a man wants a women to have an abortion and she dont then the man don't have to pay child support??? If a women can choose if she becomes a mother or not then a man should be able to decide if he becomes a father or not. Thats equal rights.
20,@SusanWade1999 @LucilleTafleur @RWPUSA And yet you are giving women the right to make the choice for a child. Thats not their decision. The child should chose. If the child continues to grow and live that's the child's right. It's not a women's right to take that away from them.
21,@AbbyGeek @clalter59 @RWPUSA @MalcolmNance Can you show proof of this? The way women can revolt is to chose not to engage in unprotected sex or have no sex unless they are wanting children. Seems like that's easiest enough. Please come after me and say what about the men and their choice to use protection. Vasectomy here.
22,@hammiesink @Obi_Obi_Chukwu @TeaPainUSA He can if he wants. The law says a teacher can't teach k-3 grades about it. They can't have a study plan. It doesn't say kids can't talk about it or do art work or nothing. Read the law and stop disinformation.
23,@flexghost1 A miscarriage is not an abortion. Try again.
24,@flexghost1 Also if you don't want a kid don't have sex. Get your tunes tied. Use birthcontroll. Abortion is not birthcontroll.
25,@flexghost1 Please stop with the disinformation. The only thing this ruling would do is send it back to the states to handle. This will not make it illegal. You are showing your ignorance as a mouth piece of disinformation.
26,"@devbost @DrSpEdinNV @JoeBiden So ending abortion would solve the issue on getting more blues in office. Think about all of the voters they have let die for votes. Now they need more, but they let them all be killed. Sounds smart to me."
27,"@devbost @DrSpEdinNV @JoeBiden How do you get the numbers??? Stop killing African Americans because hey they vote blue. Do away with abortion then there will be more of them out there to vote blue. Also to make a positive impact on our world. We can have more MLK Jr, Obama, Kamala's and so on."
28,@han_crispin @JoeBiden Well if you think telling a man he is a father how is that his choice??? How??? I know tell HIM to use protection or don't have sex. I know. Guess what women can do the same thing. You want to be able to have sex and not deal with the consequences of that choice. Selfish.
29,"@DubaldiMario @gretl08 @JoeBiden I do know who. The democratic party. They told ppl riot, loot, burn down cities until Trump is gone. You think nobody will remember but we do. And this will only make it a state issue. Why can't your state deal with it??? We will have states that murder is ok in and some say no."
30,@dearsusanbranch @JuliaDingle @JoeBiden And yet we still are. All this will do is give the states the right to make their own laws. Whats wrong with that??? It takes the Feds out of the equation. Please tell me why states can't make their own laws??? Or is it just the laws you agree with???
31,@ConcernCitZn @JoeBiden Thank you. This is what I have been saying. Also why is anyone caring at this point??? It's a draft. Wait for the published opinion to be published then let's talk about it.
32,@____A____Cqqq @MillennialF4lco @joshuagrotheer @JoeBiden Are you really prepared to loose everything you want. If you get ride of the filibuster in November the Republicans will pass a law to over turn this law and then you will have to wait for dems to take control again. Nothing new will ever be done. One side over turns the other.
33,@joshuagrotheer @JoeBiden Show me the law or five me the title of the law or the number of the law or anything that proves its a law and not just a court ruling. A court ruling isn't law. So please show me an abortion law. On the state level you can. Federal level you can't. This is a state issue not fed.

38,@POTUS @POTUS stop the disinformation. The unemployment rate dropped because businesses opened back up. The jobs was there waiting to be told go ahead and hire. And that number is low. When ppl leave unemployment or stop looking for work they aren't counted in the unemployment rate.
39,"@QTMARIANNE @SenJohnKennedy Let me clear this up for everyone. This decision is not final. This decision, if it was final, will not make abortions illegal. This will make it a states decision on abortion. It is a win for everyone. The fed gvt shouldn't control our lives. States have rights as well."
40,@Paganliam @QTMARIANNE @SenJohnKennedy You're correct. Such as that living body called a baby that is growing inside of a women.
41,@JoeBiden What are you doing to bring down Bidens Price Hikes. One of your first actions in office was kill drilling. If we still had all the drilling there wouldn't be a gas hike like we see now. That's YOUR fault not Putins.
42,"@iBooPuns @SayerMiriam @whitehouse_dog @JoJoFromJerz Well Obama for his spying on Trump and his transition. Clinton for the lies and false information given to the government, plus so much more. Let's not forget Biden. He is involved with Hunters business dealings. He knows what is going off and the evidence shows he is getting 10%"
43,"@SayerMiriam @whitehouse_dog @JoJoFromJerz But the Apply to democrates? Then Obama, Clinton, and Biden should be in jail just to name a few."
44,@boike_tracey @ResisterSis20 Why was he so bad??? I am asking because I truly want to know why YOU think he was so bad. And why not say Biden needs to be in prison as well. It has been confirmed many times over that the big guy is Joe as referred to in Hunters emails. You can't say prison for one and not oth
45,@ResisterSis20 So everyone person in church will do that??? Sounds like you are ignorant about religious people.
46,@ResisterSis20 Anti-racism starts at home. Racism is just ignorance being spewed out. Start at home with acceptance of everyone and then we can make a change.
47,@ResisterSis20 The Republicans are trying to erase history??? I'd that why the democrats are trying to remove everything dealing with the confederacy??? Is this why we don't teach the truth about slavery in any school district??? America only had about 4% of slaves. You would have us believe???

51,@joecct77 @JackPosobiec Yes so he can have someone else to blame for it.

54,@boike_tracey @Yolanda75231731 @ananavarro Have tou seen any videos of Harris doing interviews??? She is a train wreck. She is not competent one bit. Biden who knows if he is competent or if he believes the lies he tells about his sons work and the money both of them got and Joe's brother as well from these foreign govts
55,"@Energetic_Nova @southernmsgurl @5_2blue @POTUS Killing in war is murder. It may be justified, but it's still murder. Murder is taking a life, ending a life, causing death thats no from natural causes. It is murder."
56,@AndrewBlankHill # 1 not simple yes or no. # 2 it's not ok to do that to any human. # 3 why ask if it's ok for one person to do it. The question should be do I agree with anyone offering pardons to cop killers and violent protestors as a campaign tool? Not simple yes/no.
57,"@reneecomunique @SenJohnKennedy Show your proof that it's not true. Anyone can say not true, but when proof is needed most fold. Where's your proof???"
58,@007FromBankSt1 @POTUS How can we have unity with other nations when our own country is so divided. We need to worry about getting America back to being America first. Unite us the worry about uniting us with others.
59,"@kylegriffin1 @NBCNews All of you have forgotten that Republicans can confirm with the democrats. Let's see Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski and that's just naming two. So that gets rid of your fear of Senators M and S. It's about if they will do good. There will be Republicans vote to confirm the winner."
60,@realPhotoguy @Boomerbabe3 @kylegriffin1 @NBCNews What term??? It's life time appointment. Do you mean this session???
61,@ListenHere12 @POTUS @andrewkemavor How is this a civil right??? A basic one at that??? If it is a basic civil right then men would have the same right. Civil rights are equally for men and women. Your argument confuses me. Equal rights mean mean and women have the same say. Men don't so it's a special right.
62,@nogg_the @POTUS Your choice to let a man inter it. Your voice??? What about equal rights??? You women day all the time that's what you want. It's not. It's a special right you are asking for. If it was equal then a man would have an equal say. They don't so it's not equal rights.
63,"@5_2blue @POTUS So why do women get protected rights to reproduce, but a man's rights aren't protected??? Don't women want equal rights??? I hear it all the time. Women should have equal rights. I guess if it doesn't include reproductive rights. Men don't deserve that. Equal not special rights."
64,"@RutheniumGreen @POTUS Is it wrong if she is or becomes infertile due to an abortion??? She is saying she dont want kids. So if she is infertile she gets what she is asking for, no kids."
65,"@CamriTheHBIC @DutyCallsme07 @AngelaBelcamino @POTUS You didn't take every step. You did, though, forget about the most important step you could take. DONT HAVE SEX IF YOU DONT WANT A CHILD. If you don't have sex there is no way to get pregnant. Problem solved."
66,"@trying2help @RepValDemings Wow. So, a women gets to have input on everything that happens in this day and age; they get to yell about equality and equal rights about everything UNTIL it comes to abortion. When it comes to abortion then equal rights don't exist. Ok. I get it. Not equal, but special rights."
67,"@PatriciaBronst4 @Copernicus2013 @RepValDemings At all stages here, it is legal in at least one state to kill this baby. This is what they look like at this stage. At what stage do you say it is okay to kill this child?? 16, 20, 24, or maybe 30 weeks. Please look and tell me when. https://t.co/ukK4Vn2hMe"
68,@robinslj @charliehobie @DBvelin @RepValDemings @FalcnCruzr Your body your choice to spread your legs. Also don't forget the important part that you will NEVER say. Your body your choice your consequences. There's a price for everything. That includes sex. Stop treating sex as something to do and you wouldn't have to worry about murder.
69,@tbone2464_tr @CherylRosenbe15 @TheTonicmole @RepValDemings The child support still adds up and so does the interest. When he gets out and csd takes his wages he is paying. If he has no job then they will lock him up again.
70,"@CherylRosenbe15 @TheTonicmole @RepValDemings The irs takes taxes, can't get a loan or education funds, they will loose their driver's license, and how about they get locked up. In some way they all will pay. And if the women didn't want a baby then why did she have sex with the man??? Your choice ends when your legs open."
71,@the_resistor @POTUS So we are saying because Trump had operation warp speed to get the vaccine that its bidens success??? And you are claiming success because in home tests are new and not around during trumps time because he got us vaccines.
72,@PearlVCalhoun2 @CBS_Herridge Can you provide the evidence to what you stated please.
73,"@RepValDemings If they did it, why can't everyone else??? Are your parents special??? I ask this seriously. https://t.co/VUjiXDgIO1"
74,@BesaneGosolar @RepValDemings And I could say that child support is the man's money staying with said child and being forced to pay it.
75,@BesaneGosolar @RepValDemings How many women are forced to stay with the child after birth??? ZERO. How many men are forced to support a baby they never want??? Millions. How many men aren't dads because a women killed the MANS child as well when he wanted said child??? I would guess millions over time
76,@POTUS When you took office we didn't have a vaccine. Now that we have one this would have happened under Pepa 🐖.  Don't think you did something great. Inflation is a tax on all. One that hurts the lower class that needs the help the most.
77,@POTUS Why are you comparing vaccinated. One year ago there was only operation warp speed. There wasn't a vaccine to give. So duh the number would be 0. Retail sales increase is because of the price increases that has happened on your watch.

80,@Julius_Kim @bbtucker In reality the tax is on the lower income people the most. Paper isn't always how something truly is. When we put it in action the truth comes out. I can't wait for the fall out of the tax on 400k people because then the dems will loose the house senate and the white house.
81,@Julius_Kim @bbtucker Homeless people and families. The tax on the rich hurts the less fortunate people. The less you make the bigger the impact on you the taxes will have even if the taxes are on the 400k and up people. Let's use our brains for a change. On paper the tax is on 400k a year people
82,@Julius_Kim @bbtucker 400k a year mark. That is not how it works. The people under 400k WILL pay the taxes for everyone over the 400k a year. Prices will go up and Biden will say look I raised on 400k and up and cut for 400k and lower BUT 400k and lower will have less money and we will have more
83,"@Julius_Kim @bbtucker Covid is better under control- thanks warp speed

Boosters are here- thanks warp speed

Lets talk about what is not better. Inflation, taxing to pay for spending - it can and has cause recessions, not taxing anyone making less than 400k a year and cutting taxes for ppl under that"

86,This poverty thing is the numbers being used is from 2005. So how much of the 2021 childhood poverty has been eliminated? Can they just tell the truth and stop with the fake numbers please. I haven't met one child that is now out of poverty because of any policy of the presidents
87,50% equals 100%. With this I would like to tell the families that are still homeless at least they don't live in poverty. Why is it that everytime the president and his party does something it's always 50% of childhood poverty has been taken away??? One of the biggest parts of
88,I would like to congratulate the president and his party on eliminating child poverty. Back in April they say the stimulus eliminated 50% of child poverty. Now they claim that 50% of child poverty has been eliminated with the child tax credit being sent out to parents. 50% and
89,@MaryF36610129 No I was making a point. Don't talk to me about being raped. You don't wanna go down that road. The point was 12 year Olds are being raped. The government counts every 12 year old that has sex as being raped. If they stop saying yes then that rate would go down. Not disappear
90,@vickisparks @madlaine63 @RepValDemings We can't fight the same fight together??? Sounds like you want division and special rights for women. It's about equal rights I thought.
91,"I am tired of hearing the president and his party say that these two bills he wants to pass won't cost middle America, and lower income America, anything. Unless I missed the part that days the government will be sending checks out to everyone for the increase in their expenses."
