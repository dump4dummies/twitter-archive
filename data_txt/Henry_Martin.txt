1,"@KUMeek @ginamccarthy46 @WhiteHouse @RepHartzler @RepSamGraves Sam Graves recognizes it, he's just paid by Big Oil to fight against it every step of the way."
2,@DerrickNowlinMO Powerful photo!
3,"Sam Graves wants the government to criminalize safe abortions. When Missourians go to the polls this election, they should make the safe choice and vote Henry Martin for Congress in the 6th district! https://t.co/4c1Mxq1Ppp"
4,"@HerPerspectiv3 That's the way to go! If you can support a progressive candidate near you, please do, because progressive candidates don't get the same support from Big Oil &amp; Big Pharma that the establishment does."
5,"Big Oil is gouging Americans at the pump, and then sending kickbacks to their most loyal politicians. All the campaign donations that my Republican opponent gets from Big Oil is his #1 reason for voting against a real solution to high gas prices."
6,"@HerPerspectiv3 I send fundraising emails because Missouri just outlawed all abortions, and I'm terrified for my 3 daughters. The Democrats in power failed to codify Roe, and that's why we need to put new Dems in power. Without help from folks, we can't put real Pro-Choice Champions in Congress."
7,"Yes. THIS is how the Democratic party should be operating. If we become the party of farmers, union workers, and teachers Missouri turns BLUE! https://t.co/vzYAiYwA14"

That one move would allow so many more Dems in these rural areas to make leaps and bounds in their races. Right now, a couple thousand of dollars to access data seems out of reach for many rural folks."
9,"@TweetsofCooper @MannyAbarcaIV @CharlesWestfor1 @sofreshandsoKT @Michael4Mo @piper4missouri @MissouriGOP @MoDemParty @TheDemocrats @MO_HouseDems @MoSenDems The party is ours and I understand your frustration. Manny is asking a legitimate question as the party has a lot of issues to cover. Those of us in rural areas where our neighbors do not have a central committee, we need to extend help where we can and inform the party."
10,"@MannyAbarcaIV @CharlesWestfor1 @sofreshandsoKT @Michael4Mo @piper4missouri @MissouriGOP @MoDemParty @TheDemocrats @MO_HouseDems @MoSenDems $$$ would allow committees to hire professional staffers &amp; canvassers to teach them the ropes of political organizing. It would allow them to rent physical offices, it would allow them to print literature. You can't win elections or build up local committees without these things."
11,@MannyAbarcaIV @CharlesWestfor1 @sofreshandsoKT @Michael4Mo @piper4missouri @MissouriGOP @MoDemParty @TheDemocrats @MO_HouseDems @MoSenDems Get rid of the cost to VAN for downballot candidates and for committees so they can contact voters without breaking the bank. Send professional staffers out to these committees to teach them how to organize and build power. Things like this would empower rural Democrats a ton!
12,"@MannyAbarcaIV @CharlesWestfor1 @sofreshandsoKT @Michael4Mo @piper4missouri @MissouriGOP @MoDemParty @TheDemocrats @MO_HouseDems @MoSenDems I am the President of the Northland Democrats Club, yes I'm ready to organize. We have democrat voters in Randolph &amp; Mercer county, for example, but there is no $$$ or guide for them to form a real cmtte. Without $$$ or real help from the party, these Dems are swimming upstream."
13,"@MannyAbarcaIV @CharlesWestfor1 @sofreshandsoKT @Michael4Mo @piper4missouri @MissouriGOP @MoDemParty @TheDemocrats @MO_HouseDems @MoSenDems While I agree sharing posts isn't the right ask, a real issue is the lack of help and direction given by party leaders. In my district, MO-6, there are 5 counties WITHOUT local committees. There's no decentralization happening in these counties, the state needs to steps up &amp; act."

31,"Joe Biden should immediately issue a ‚Äúblanket pardon‚Äù to anyone who gets an abortion and to any doctor or clinic which provides it. I don't care if that will go to court, I don't care if it will make Republicans mad: we must do EVERYTHING we can to preserve reproductive choice."
