5,"I attended the ceremony renaming the Alachua County Courthouse in honor of Judge Stephan P. Mickle, Sr.  He graduated from UF law school within a couple years of my grandfather.

6,"Florida must stop terminating kids from extended foster care for non-compliance with the education requirement. The state removes foster kids from their family and community, so we have a duty to assist kids who age out of care, even if their mental health precludes compliance."
7,"Florida must invest in more mental health services for children, particularly residential treatment facilities for kids in the foster system and kids whose parents just need help. I have seen many examples of kids going from one disrupted placement to the next waiting for a bed."

10,"Alcohol should not be a dominant part of Florida culture.  The bars should be turned into coffee shops and tea houses, not through prohibition but by consumer demand. Alcohol greatly harms Florida families. https://t.co/T90MZECEZ3"
