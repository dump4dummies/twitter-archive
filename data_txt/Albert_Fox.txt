1,"@tamisfitlife Please understand. I am not giving up!
Devoted 22 years of my life and thousands and thousands of dollars. Been burglarized three times, car tires flattened several times etc. I Know how to handle Fascist Batista Cubans. But, my party is keeping me off the ballot not Rubio types!"
2,"@RepValDemings I have a adopted, special needs child. You need not politicize every damn issue!Because you spent the “morning with Leroy” accomplished what? What was the purpose? Stop listening to Pelosi political hack advisors and just be yourself! You will have more respect!"
3,"@ananavarro You are very right. She should get her job back with back pay and then some more money!
On another subject you are way to smart to have ignorant position on US Cuba policy. Your friend Jen Bush is wrong, all wrong on his Fascist Batista US Cuba policy!
Do the right thing!"
4,"@EvelynPR You need keep fighting the fight! We need to develop young leaders that will not whore themselves for money and not be “afraid” to take the right positions on issues. Example!What is difference between Niki, Charlie and Marco on US Cuba policy? Nothing! That is our problem!"
5,@Raquel_MiamiBch What is your position on US Cuba relations? If it is like Marco Rubio no need to respond!
6,@USCubaNowPAC Very true and accurate. It is a sad commentary that the US blockade/embargo toward Cuba is stronger today than at any time in the last 62 years! How sad and pathetic is that.
7,@USCubaNowPAC Thank you

9,@sanchezforsen Please explain. What is message? AL at work???
10,@RepValDemings Wow! What a brilliant statement!
11,@Emywinst Excellent question. It cannot blame Fox News. They are smart. The Administration is like amateur hour. Why even recognize Doocy ever? Always playing the “I got you game”! The new press spokesperson has to go. She is horrible!
12,"@CalltoActivism Madam, 
Thank you for your courage and service. You are what America is about or should be about! The late Howie Liebengood was a friend of mine.  
Be well. 
Respectfully,

13,"@CarolineMcPhD Dr. If you have not tried to get Val Demings to “understand” US Cuba policy please try!
It is pathetic listening to Demings trying to out Rubio Rubio on US Cuba policy!"
14,@RepValDemings @ABCGMA3 @SpecialOlympics Why did you allow yourself to go from being a damn good congresswomen from Orlando to political hack for the National and State democratic parties? You cannot believe the propaganda the party has you “parroting”regarding US Cuba policy. You are not out Rubio Rubio on Cuba policy!
15,@mariashriver Remember day often! I was young aid on Senate floor. Was in discussions with Senator and press aide F Mancwich about joining campaign. RFK never signed his senate desk. Two of us from the Cloakroom craved RFK’s name in his  senate desk! A special moment in my life.
16,"@sanchezforsen Will, you are not running against Rubio! You are running in a Democratic Primary against five other democrats! Sad to see you copying Demings campaign style!"
17,@BlackKnight10k You are so right!
18,"@CarolineMcPhD @miamiabel The real problem is Dem. Party is run by “local and state cabals”! Can be great loyal democrat but if you cross the cabal or they do not like you they will blackball you from participation and office! Example,Val Demings! She was anointed by the cabals and cannot defeat Rubio!"
19,"@valdemings It is beyond tragic and pathetic Val Demings as a candidate for the US Senate just “parrots” Marco Rubio’s views on US Cuba relations!
To continue to pander to the Miami Batista types is a disservice to America."
20,@CarolineMcPhD Agree. Which countries are you thinking about?
21,See this Instagram video by @alfox4senate https://t.co/Xox21na9E2
22,@VaheRocks @GiancarloSopo JFK did not “bungle” Bay of Pigs Invasion. The “CIA organized”invasion was kept secret from US government and the brave Cubans who were told when they “hit the beach” the Cuban people would rise up and join them. The CIA knew that was a lie!
23,"Debate your opponents for the Democratic nomination @RepValDemings .
Let’s talk #Cuba policy, #LatinAmerica policy, #Immigration https://t.co/ZMEUNSPd0W"
24,@Marcus4Georgia Correct! 100% correct!
25,@WHAAsstSecty If the US government supports the people of Cuba it would remove the immoral US embargo!
26,@valdemings What an ignorant and sophomoric statement! Val Demings knows nothing about US Cuba policy except she supports Marco Rubio’s position!
27,@PhilPeters1 My President is an embarrassment on US Cuba policy!
28,"@PhilPeters1 I was on the Senate floor when Senator Hurska stuck his foot in his mouth!
Mediocrity has no place in US policy!"
29,@PhilPeters1 We must purge the fascist/Batista Cubans from the US State Department or we will never have constructive engagement with Cuba!
30,@PhilPeters1 It is a sad commentary that the  opposition crowd to US embargo on Cuba does not speak with one voice!
31,@John_Hudson @PhilPeters1 100% correct. Cuba should not be on US terrorist list!
32,@John_Hudson @PhilPeters1 When US puts countries on the list of terrorist countries that are not terrorist countries it cheapens the list!

34,@NacionyEmig @cubavsbloqueo Great job Max! I am grateful to be an American BUT we must continue working to remove the immoral US blockade of Cuba!
35,@cubavsbloqueo You have my support today and for last 22 years!
36,"@sanchezforsen Agree with Sanchez. Look at all the Senate candidates record. Also, will learn Sanchez, Rubio and Demings all support the immoral US embargo toward Cuba. Miami/Batista Cubans are driven by hatred. The people in Cuba suffer because of US embargo. Remove embargo!!"
37,"@DHBennett3 @BarbHunter18 @valdemings You should feel terrible.
Not “bickering”.
Been involved in politics’highest levels since 1965, including as Senate staff in US Senate chamber!
Please listen: we are headed for the biggest defeat in Democratic Party history! Demings  will lose to Rubio + we lose Senate + House!"
38,@000hhmmm000 @valdemings Using Donald Trump Twitter tactics- saying up is down and down is up-does not enhance our party’s chances of winning! Distorting my record will not help Demings or any other democrats win!
39,"@RonaldAGrump1 @valdemings If you want to be ignorant about all the democratic candidates in US Senate primary race by blindly supporting VD because Pelosi says so— be my guest!
Rubio will defeat Demings by 5 to 10 points even after spending 50 million dollars or more!!"
40,"@gpmiami @valdemings If you are disrespected, have lies spread about you, fundraisers are told not to contribute by the party elders who anointed VD would you support VD? I do not think so! VD should dictate the goals of her campaign. She should not allow party hacks to control her campaign!"
41,@RonaldAGrump1 @valdemings You are  exactly voter the party loves. Vote for her without knowing qualifications of all candidates! That is exactly why the party gave her 30 million to dupe voters like you! I cannot be bought. Party has told Demings what her position on US Cuba policy is— just like Rubio’s!
42,@uccat1960 @SStarr1505 @valdemings Endorsements are part of politics. But when there is a primary race with 6 candidates it is ALWAYS best to let the candidates debate and let the voters “endorse” the best candidate for the general election!
43,@000hhmmm000 @Jeff13044856 @SStarr1505 @valdemings I welcome a comparison of my record! That is all I ask!
44,@SStarr1505 @valdemings Of course! Look at my record and career accomplishments.
45,@SStarr1505 @valdemings All I ask is to look at my record and career!
46,@USCubaNowPAC @000hhmmm000 @BradHay81784135 @Larrylarrea4 @valdemings Absolutely correct!
47,@SStarr1505 @valdemings Look up my record and career!
48,"@BananaZ0609 @SStarr1505 @valdemings What an ignorant statement!
I will put my civil rights record against yours and Val Demings! I was a U.S. Commissioner on Martin Luther King, Jr Federal Holiday Commission. Dr King was a friend of mine. You should not copy Donald Trump twitter tactics!"
49,"@uccat1960 @SStarr1505 @valdemings Lookup definition of whining! It is not “whining” when you expose the truth!
There is a primary system for a reason! It is to get the best candidate not the “anointed” candidate by party “bosses”!"
50,@gpmiami @valdemings I will not support Demings or Rubio nor will my friends! She allowed herself to be manipulated by Democratic Party to run dishonest campaign! She tells everyone she is running against Rubio. That is a lie! She is running in a democratic primary! She should debate the candidates!
51,"@Spencetology @valdemings Well let’s have a debate or two first. Let the voters decide.

You know, fair competition like Democrats are supposed to believe in and stand for? 

Our party has to walk it’s talk."
52,"@SStarr1505 @valdemings Never insulted voter. Contrary, I want voters to decide. My record:expert on Senate procedures, participated First Earth day celebration, US Commissioner on MLK Holiday Commission, advised SA government to release Mandela, expert on immigration, climate change,LBTQ and more!"
53,"@Jeff13044856 @000hhmmm000 @SStarr1505 @valdemings It is unfortunate for her she gave up her safe House seat. 

And you are correct most of the money funding her campaign comes from outside FL. 

FL Dem party voters deserve a fair primary election process with debates and a real campaign to choose the nominee."
54,"@USDodgedABullet @LordMakonnen @valdemings I am pointing out the truth about this primary process. I am asking for a fair election process with debates and all of that. 
As for # followers ask me the same question after the Natl/State Party elites raise $30M for my campaign like they did for Val.She is still behind Rubio."
55,@SStarr1505 Visit my website https://t.co/vrBXxCXqKm  Follow me and ask all the questions you want.  Meet with me.
56,"@SStarr1505 @valdemings We need to have a proper primary election process w/debates and all that goes with it.  

Val wants to bypass it. Natl/State D pty elites have decided who the nominee is instead of you the voter.

I am the solution to the Rubio problem. 

Let the voters hear from us and choose."
57,"@valdemings Stop playing politics as you’re not the nominee yet.

Compete. Debate me and the others.  Let FL Dem voters decide who is best to challenge and defeat Rubio. 

Respectfully the party elites got you $30M+ so far, a full service campaign, and you’re still not ahead of Rubio."
58,"@techytim @Larrylarrea4 @valdemings 2- They anointed VD and exclude all others. 

Call for the party to host a debate between ALL the candidates. 

Hear me. Look at my record. Then I will respect the decision of the voters!

VD has already spent 
$30M with $25M on the way. She will never defeat light weight Rubio!"
59,"@techytim @Larrylarrea4 @valdemings 1- My friend you need to look up the definition of slander! I did not slander VD. 

HOWEVER, I agree with you. You should know why I and perhaps a few other democratic candidates are better than VD in this election cycle. BUT the Natl/State Dem parties do not want you to know…"
60,@RepValDemings Electing honest political people who want to be public servants is “how we keep America great”! Politicians who blindly follow the party political hacks like you do America a great disservice!
61,"@RepValDemings Val Demings, I knew and lobbied Patsy Mink “you are no Patsy Mink”!"
62,"@todoscondemings @DHCFMiami Porque apoyar a Demings si apenas ni conozca #Cuba, y no hay diferencia entre Val y Marco Rubio sobre nuestra política a Cuba?

Cuandos vamos a debate Val? 

Que sabes realmente del tema? 

Yo soy CubanoAmericano y listo a enfrentar Rubio. 

Usted no ha ganado la primaria aún."
63,"@marcorubio @Google @gmail Actually @valdemings isn’t running against you yet. She’s confused or mishandled by party elites. 

She’s running against me and others in a primary so the best of us can run against you/send you back to Miami as a private citizen.

I look forward to that challenge against you."
64,"@BarbHunter18 @valdemings We agree on that point. 

Problem is Val acts like she’s the nominee and she’s not. She has to debate me and the other Dem candidates and show who is actually best to take on Rubio. You don’t get to skip the rules.

$30M spent by Val and she still can’t outpoll Rubio.🤦🏻‍♂️"
65,@RepJayapal Those sophomoric comments are the problem. The senate can never be a small version of the House! Instead of Majorly Leader whinnying about this and that use Rule 22 of the senate to our advantage.  That is what Mitch McConell does!
66,@valdemings The best way to serve your community and your self is to be honest! You are not running against Marco Rubio! You are running against four qualified and loyal democrats! Once you start selling out it becomes addictive and you are no longer an honorable public servant!

68,@DearAuntCrabby I am with you 100%.  I thank the good lord he made me a man. I could not take all the crap/abuse/harassment woman have to deal with in our society every damn day!
69,@LordMakonnen It is difficult discussing US Cuba policy with persons who are biased or ignorant on the policy. So what if the Cuban government is a dictatorship! So damn what! Is that a reason to make the people of Cuba suffer because of a immoral US blockade based on hatred and vengeance!!
70,@RepValDemings Why don’t you play by the election rules!
71,@RepValDemings It is a sad commentary watching you “develop” from the public servant you were to political hack today! Fire all your advisors and start abiding by the Democratic primary election rules.
72,"@RepValDemings You don’t play by the rules when it comes to our US Primary race.

You act like you’re the nominee and you are not still. You forget you have a primary.  And you won’t debate me and the other candidates. Why?

Everyone loses with such arrogance."
73,"@valdemings First win the Dem primary.

Debate me and the others. 

Prove you are the best to represent our party against Rubio.  You’re not. $30M spent so far and you can’t outpoll Rubio. You sacrificed your safe House seat.

Party elites have hamstrung the electoral process in our race."
74,"@valdemings $30M spent and you still cannot outpoll Rubio.

You refuse to debate me and others for the Dem nomination, which party elites want you to have.

You know little about #Cuba and support our failed policies.

FL deserves a better US Senator and one who can beat Rubio."
75,@StateDept @POTUS The Biden proposal is all “hat and no cattle”! It will accomplish nothing!
76,@sanchezforsen You cannot solve the Ukraine invasion! But you can greatly help solve the insane and immoral US Cuba policy!

88,"@valdemings Debate me and your fellow Democrats vying for the nomination on our policies in Latin America and the Caribbean.  

Florida deserves a US Senate Dem Nominee who actually knows the subject matter, can defeat Rubio, and take that to the US Senate.

You’re all talking points Val."
89,"@Herostratus356 @PartyWurmple The Castro’s communism, political prisoners, human rights violations and more have absolutely nothing to do with US blockade of Cuba!
