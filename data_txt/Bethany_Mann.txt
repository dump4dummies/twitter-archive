1,"These laws make our country less safe, particularly in states with trigger laws like Missouri, where rural families already drive many hours for  basic medical care that costs too much. Missourians can‚Äôt afford to live through another healthcare crisis due to failed leadership."
2,"I call on President Biden to use his executive authority to protect the rights of military service members from being able to access reproductive healthcare services wherever they are stationed, without imposing undue financial burden or invading their privacy. (7/8)"
3,"We must vote in every election, and end gerrymandering that prevents Missourians from overturning extreme laws that violate human rights. (6/8)"
4,"What do we do next? Congress must immediately pass the Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act, and the Equal Rights Amendment should be fully ratified. The Supreme Court should be expanded. (5/8)"
5,"Meanwhile, the same wealthy groups of leaders and their donors decimate public education, strip workers of their rights, and allow corporations to wreck our environment by polluting our water and farmland. This must end. (4/8)"
6,It‚Äôs  no accident that this decision happens during Pride month. It sends a clear message for whose rights will be next. (3/8)
7,"It has nothing to do with babies or the sanctity of life to those who propagate false information about abortion and other forms of healthcare. It‚Äôs about money, power, division, and erasure. (2/8)"
8,"Yesterday‚Äôs decision to overturn Roe comes after decades of organized efforts to dismantle human rights, so that Christofascists can rise to power on the backs of U.S. workers, particularly women and those in marginalized communities with high maternal death rates. (1/8)"

I will work with her to deliver more green infrastructure to strengthen our supply chain and clean up our environment. https://t.co/FQzfrLH6Lm"
13,"@WiseLionMan Thank you for spreading the word. If anyone wants to learn more about PFAS and one of the companies responsible for pollution, watch Dark Waters. I started my career as an @EPA intern, and I am passionate about protecting the environment, particularly from big corporations"
14,"Water that goes into our wastewater treatment facilities should be poison-free. Water that flows out of our faucets at home should be lead-free. It‚Äôs time to hold big corporations accountable for pollution, and we must update rural water infrastructure #MannOnTheEnvironment"
15,"The @EPA just released a new health advisory for PFAS, PFOA, and GenX chemicals. We must make sure that Missouri receives money to clean up our water in rural areas, not just in big cities or affluent communities. #EPA #MannAtWork #PFAS #DarkWaters https://t.co/qDbDulG9lP"

20,"Many Dem donors have decided to put money into a hotly contested Senate race, unwittingly leaving down ballot Dems to struggle until after the primary. It‚Äôs expensive to drive around MO-3, drop literature, and coordinate events. Please consider donating at https://t.co/NAzMwcUFZk"
21,"Congratulations on filing, Starbucks heroes at 5th and Boonslick! Unions improve pay and working conditions all over Missouri. Thank you for your leadership. I‚Äôll see you on Friday! @SBWorkersUnited #UnionStrong #Solidarity https://t.co/GTZPpTjJb6"
22,"Those who use fear and threats to control the access of information at a public library do not support a free and fair democracy. These threats should be taken seriously, and crimes like this should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. (2/2)."
23,"I call on the FBI and local law enforcement to find and charge the domestic terrorists who threatened violence against librarians, children, and families in Crawford County. Intimidation will not be tolerated. (1/2)"
24,"Threats of violence against political opponents, regardless of party, have no place in civilized society. This behavior will not end until stronger leaders demand accountability from weak men, and politicians stop cashing checks from organizations that support domestic terrorism."
25,"Pathetic machismo aside, it should be much harder for a person with multiple allegations of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse to obtain a gun. It should be impossible for them to become a U.S. Senator."
26,@ghank I appreciate the vote. Thank you for the donation.
27,"@CountryTeacher3 I think that public schools should be fully and equitably funded. Teachers, like all workers, should be allowed to collectively bargain. We should raise teacher pay, and invest in technology and infrastructure upgrades (buses, clean water, and roads)."
28,RT @MaryK1987: We deserve a better representative than Luetkemeyer. Vote him out. I'm voting for @Mann4Congress.

30,"Check out the new website! It features a little more about me, a MO-3 GIS map, info on how to check your voter registration, and it outlines my policy. It‚Äôs much more accessible, and I think that my team did a great job in collaboratively creating it.

33,"4th b/c Missouri‚Äôs representatives make a lot of money from lobby groups that write their policy. Policies written to generate as much money as possible off of the backs of working families. At a certain point, we must admit that this practice is fatal, and it kills our children. https://t.co/JS4AnEfGIq"
34,@Tara4Missouri I am so excited to see this rally happen in O‚ÄôFallon too! This rally is right next to the QT my family used to go to on the way to church when I was growing up. Thank you for rallying in Rolla!!
35,"‚ÄúI have faith that women make an informed decision when they consent to an abortion. It is not my place to stand in judgment of a woman who decides to have an abortion as I do not know her story and have not walked in her shoes.‚Äù Beautiful opinion.

38,I‚Äôll be there too!! See you there! https://t.co/cixHDMlTBi
39,The US Government must protect students and teachers from violent domestic terrorists and the politicians who enable them to finance their political campaigns.
40,"Most Americans agree on common sense gun regulation, yet a minority bent on accepting money for inaction continues to terrorize public institutions like American schools. We must start calling them out for their greed plainly. We cannot allow this to continue."
41,"It‚Äôs entirely possible to come up with one or two actions that would decrease gun violence, like fully funding research studies to tell us why this keeps happening, smarter gun regulation, buy-back programs, permits, or red flag laws."
42,"Gun violence continues to happen because politicians accept money from lobby groups to do nothing while corporations profit, even if it means that children die. We must remove big money from US elections &amp; elect leaders who value our future more than cash and power."
43,"@Tara4Missouri Thank you, Tara!! #CompassionRebellion"
44,@robertbucklin8 @dbrlworkers Those who knew about the abuse and did nothing are accomplices.
45,"@robertbucklin8 @dbrlworkers Yes. It should be closed immediately, and those responsible for abusing children must see criminal and civil punishment."
46,"better wages, benefits, and safer working conditions. Unions make working conditions better for everyone in Missouri.

47,"I stand in solidarity with @dbrlworkers ! Congratulations on your historic union vote. Thank you for your leadership and service. Libraries give so much to our communities, and librarians (like all of us) deserve a seat at the table to collectively bargain for (1/2) https://t.co/ysvFxmCsRW"

49,"Last Saturday, we joined @ProChoice_MO for the #BansOffOurBodies weekend of action. Abortion is healthcare, and these gross bans only limit options to healthcare in a state struggling to meet basic services, especially in rural parts of Missouri. https://t.co/DeEn5BA8IX"
50,"Just to be clear, to solve a baby formula safety &amp; supply issue caused directly by skirting safety inspectors &amp; not keeping up w/ routine maintenance due to cost @RepBlaine thinks the solution is de-regulation (you know, getting rid of the safety inspectors in the first place). https://t.co/BxCKcP1kzU"
51,"@RepBlaine voted AGAINST the Access to Baby Formula Act at a time when parents desperately need formula. He has the power to do something to alleviate the suffering of those in his district, but time and time again, he chooses the profit of corporations over public health"

55,@Tara4Missouri @RandiMcCallian Hi Tara!! Hi Randi!!
56,"@emzorbit Exactly. There‚Äôs a long history of why certain regulations exist, and they all trace back to corporations putting profits over people, their health, and the environment. Some companies find it easier to write the check for a repeat violation than fix the problem"
57,"@bethjournals Blaming Biden is a laughable cop-out from reps who intentionally mislead voters. They know the game. Simply, corporate donors pay good money for de-regulation. A bad audit or recall upsets shareholders. It doesn‚Äôt matter who gets adversely impacted or killed when money‚Äôs at stake"
58,"Two corporations account for ~80% of baby formula on the market. Issues with the plant in MI go back to 2019, and involve deliberate attempts to mislead safety inspectors. It‚Äôs time to stop consolidating American manufacturing, &amp; fully fund agencies that protect our supply chain"
59,"We will stand together and mobilize the vote on August 2nd and November 8th.

When we win, we will codify Roe."
60,"We should not be deterred by bullies who will use their religion as a weapon to harm others. We reject anti-science and anti-healthcare rhetoric that only seek to subvert, divide, and control the American workforce."
61,"Working families deserve accessible and affordable healthcare. Healthcare should not be limited or eliminated based on our employment, gender, or financial means. Our bodies and the care of our bodies will not be controlled by government overreach."
62,"It is a mechanism of control by those who seek to divide us and keep us focused on fighting against each other, instead of rising up and defending our freedom from those who profit from the labor of our bodies."
63,Forcing anyone to carry a pregnancy against their will constitutes political violence against those with uteruses.
64,"Abortion is healthcare. Restricting a person‚Äôs ability to access healthcare because they do not share some personal religious beliefs makes bad policy with deadly consequences in a state with alarmingly high maternal death rates, particularly among black mothers."
65,"Thank you to @SBWorkersUnited for organizing, and thank you to everyone who took the time to show solidarity. You set an example that lifts up every worker in this state.

70,"Special thanks to @UAW2250 and @STCDEMS for showing up #UnionStrong for Starbucks‚Äô workers.

79,"The right to vote is as fundamental as the Constitution. Limiting access to voting options is antithetical to the basic idea of By The People. We must pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, stop gerrymandering, and improve voter registration in every neighborhood. https://t.co/KcLNQCoxnw"
