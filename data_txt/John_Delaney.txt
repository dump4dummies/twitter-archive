0,@eskohn I think we are saying the same thing. What McConnell did to Garland was both unconstitutional and it shattered an important norm of governance.
1,"@eskohn I'm a huge RBG fan, she's an extraordinary figure who had a profoundly positive impact on American life. Having said all that, not stepping down was a mistake"
2,"@eskohn If you are not honest about mistakes, you don't learn and improve. Pretty basic, actually.  If you hide mistakes you never improve."
3,"3 big mistakes that set up the end of Roe

1. Not codifying Roe into law in '09
2. Dems losing Senate in '14 &amp; WH in '16 
3. RBG not retiring

1 was a bad decision

2 happened b/c Dems lost working class voters by large margins for the first time

3 was a selfish decision"

@MittRomney

@BillCassidy 

You don't have to agree with them on everything to acknowledge they get things done!"

11,"Missing a key fact. 

The highway trust fund, which is funded by the gas tax, was underfunded when Obama was running

The bipartisan infrastructure bill significantly increased funding for the highway trust fund - it is not underfunded today (thanks to Biden) https://t.co/ItDchA3BHV"

15,"While not nearly as functional as it should be, there are signs of life in the Senate. Between the historic infrastructure bill and the recent gun safety framework, there are signs of progress, mostly driven by Senate moderates.  https://t.co/COW5IxeOU5"
16,"In hindsight there is little question that federal gov't &amp; Fed provided excess stimulus, contributing to inflation.  But what was the choice? Too little - that would have been worse. There was no roadmap for how to handle a global shutdown and very hard to get precisely right."
17,@deep_navy I didn't say the Fed was wrong - my point was this is likely going to get bad.
18,"The CNBC crowd is overly focused on the drop in stock prices, wipe out of crypto currencies etc

The real actions will occur in the real economy. The Fed will keep raising rates until it slows the economy, which will unfortunately drive up unemployment, lower wages &amp; hurt folks"
19,"This feels like a problem that will correct itself. Between higher fuel costs and a slowing economy driven by higher interest rates, travel should slow allowing the airlines to catch up on staffing etc.  https://t.co/hdEF81gzYO"
20,"Some things are predictable. 

Inflation is high, the Fed is raising rates, the stock &amp; housing markets crash and psychology turns negative. A recession will be soon be upon us accompanied with rising unemployment.   Then a ferocious fight will start about cutting rates....."

27,"@theboanderson They did a lot, but the market can only bear so much."
28,"If interest rates were the same as they were when Clinton was President, which is where they are roughly heading, then interest on the federal debt would go from 5-6% of the federal budget to ~10-15% (depending on term).   Look for this to lead to intense budget/deficit fights."
29,"The economy can do fine with higher rates. During Clinton's Presidency, a time of strong economic growth, rates were much higher than they are today

Higher rates will flush speculative investing, which is probably good

But higher rates will also grow the deficit, which is bad"
30,"Why are costs so high in the US?

Recent monetary policy and stimulus,
NIMBY housing policies,
Excess regulation,
Lack of universal healthcare,
No efforts to control drug costs,
Outdated antitrust laws, and
No industrial policy focused on supply chain. 

All fixable"
31,"We need universal healthcare - where every American has a basic healthcare package for free. It would save lives and lower costs.  Unfortunately too many think the only way to have universal healthcare is with a single payer system, which is bad policy and unpopular. https://t.co/x3BThTEt4z"
32,"He's right. If we want to rebuild America's infrastructure, decarbonize, and generally usher in a more sustainable world then regulators have to be aligned around this mission.  https://t.co/ba0qiZVcfA"
33,"One of the main reasons housing is unaffordable is because NIMBY community groups and activists (of all politics - liberal, progressive and conservative) have successfully fought and defeated new multi family development projects and efforts to zone greater density."
34,@ViraniAlim Tax incentives and accelerated approvals for investments in the supply chain would boost the economy and also address supply chain issues.
35,The Fed will likely raise rates higher than expected to combat rising inflation. Rising rates will undoubtedly slow the economy and likely lead to a recession.  The best way to avoid/soften a recession is with fiscal and regulatory policies geared to one goal: encouraging growth.
36,"Gas prices are too high - they are hurting hardworking families and we need to do what we can to lower them.   The American people know this - they pay for it each week

It's not really necessary or productive for the media to write every other story about high gas prices!"
37,Clearly excess money supply from fiscal &amp; monetary stimulus is driving inflation but other drivers include a restructuring of the global supply chain post Covid &amp; war in Ukraine.   Regulatory relief &amp; accelerated approvals for investments in supply chain related assets would help
38,"The negatives of inflation should not be underestimated  - it destroys the earning power of low income and working class Americans and pushes people into poverty. Runaway inflation, left unchecked, is worse than slowing economic growth. https://t.co/diz9LoAWIP"

We don't need (or want) to agree with our elected leaders on everything, but we need elected leaders who have unwavering loyalty to constitution and country"
42,"Fighting a two front war is very hard

Biden is dealing with Republicans who wrongly blame him for inflation and with Democrats who ignore his significant accomplishments and blame him for not advancing ideas that not even a majority of Democrats support!"
43,"Biden's numbers would be stronger if some Democrats would wake up to the facts, stop blaming him for not doing more, and start realizing that he has the one of the thinnest Congressional margins in history! In that context, what he has done is very significant."
44,"Inflation was largely inevitable after Covid. Should Congress/WH/Fed done some things differently with fiscal and monetary policy with the benefit of hindsight? Yes, but an inflationary ""snapback"" was largely inevitable IMO and unfair to blame on Biden."
45,"Unfortunately, none of these candidates has a chance of beating Trump in a primary.  The only one who has any shot is DeSantis. The problem DeSantis has is that the other candidates will run and dilute the non-Trump vote  https://t.co/ZiMonwIYjJ"

47,"What was interesting about this race is that many of the most vocal Bass supporters (not Bass herself) focused on the fact that Caruso was previously a Republican, which is relevant to some but not all, instead of focusing on the issues.

51,Karen Bass is a proven and successful public servant but the sentiment among voters is strongly in favor of either a different kind of politics or outsiders. The LA mayor's race between Caruso &amp; Bass will be an indicator of what voters are really thinking. https://t.co/86kW31KG4m
52,"@Pace_Super7 The DC is a ""swamp"" is lazy and wrong. DC, like all places, has some great people &amp; some not great people. In fact, DC is full of people who served our nation, currently serve our nation &amp; have dedicated their lives to service. Are you saying they don't give a damn about America?"
53,"@Pace_Super7 The Fed ""reacts"" to either high unemployment or high inflation - that's its mandate. If you believe excess spending is contributing to inflation (which it is), that spending was done by the current and prior administrations in equal measure, or perhaps you missed that."
54,Reducing inflation generally is overwhelmingly under the control of the Federal Reserve through monetary policy. Elected officials can do VERY little to reduce inflation generally other than tweaks to specific supply chain issues that only impact individual components.
55,"There is an interesting fiscal dynamic occurring where state budgets are flush with surpluses, in part due to Federal aid to states (which aid created large federal deficits). Many states are using that money for various kinds of relief, which creates more inflationary pressures."

64,"""Balancing the budget"" sounds good but its dumb economic policy - pursuing it would crush the economy. We don't need a balanced budget, we need the deficit to be less than GDP growth.
