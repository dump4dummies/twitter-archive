1,"@BrianMcLain15 @CONNIENICHOL @JennUWinn84 @DeidreDeJear Yeah, we can get something going before the general, I‚Äôm sure."
2,@CONNIENICHOL @BrianMcLain15 @JennUWinn84 @DeidreDeJear I can work with you to put something together and to get the word out. Shoot me an email to start the conversation. Thanks!
3,@CONNIENICHOL @BrianMcLain15 @JennUWinn84 @DeidreDeJear Email me at melton4iowa@gmail.com and we‚Äôll see about scheduling something in your area. What town and county are you in?

5,I enjoyed my time in Tabor yesterday! https://t.co/DwRu9XpzZI
6,I enjoyed speaking to the folks in Council Bluffs yesterday! https://t.co/n169TUdOjx
7,@Alejbkr Perhaps all the SCOTUS judges who affirmed and reaffirmed the right over five decades could?
8,"I‚Äôve spoken with women in the 4th District since Friday in Sioux City, Elk Horn, Council Bluffs, Nevada, Ames, and Tabor. Their reactions to the Roe news range from shock to dismay to hopelessness to betrayal. The universal across the 4th?  Resolve. Determination.  Strength."
9,@bradical31 I‚Äôd argue people value representative democracy when it properly represents the will of the people. We need to get back there.
10,"@IowaRallyYak @NickJSchmitt87 You‚Äôre certainly adding a lot of context for him that he didn‚Äôt add, and you‚Äôre certainly excising the political context of the moment."
11,"@IowaRallyYak @NickJSchmitt87 An awful lot of people read his tweet the way I‚Äôm reading it.  Tweets exist within the context they are tweeted in. You can‚Äôt excise it the way you are attempting.  And even if your argument is that his tweet was just sloppy, the lack of thoughtfulness is concerning regardless."
12,"@Bluejacket1776 Your name calling doesn‚Äôt phase me. Beyond that, the more you type, the more it seems you‚Äôre twisting yourself in a pretzel to take his tweet out of its context to make it more sanitized than it actually was."
13,@Bluejacket1776 @LangeChristy You‚Äôre a rather grumpy fellow. Is this hitting a nerve for some reason?  It seems the projection and volume and name calling is potentially being used as a tactic to obfuscate and distract.
14,@Bluejacket1776 I have an M.A. in U.S. History.
15,@Bluejacket1776 His tweet seems pretty clear to most reading it that it is what he means. And he‚Äôs not the only one.
16,@CorrectlyIncor2 Sen. Cornyn tweeted it.
17,"But I‚Äôm open to ideas. Certainly though, SCOTUS is a political entity at this point."
18,"I‚Äôm not in favor of expanding the court as that doesn‚Äôt get to the root of the problem. I do think it‚Äôs time to consider term limits or a renominating process every 10 years, or possibly every 12 (based on every other Senate election cycle RE: Senate Judiciary Comm.)."
19,"Morning reflections: SCOTUS is rather unresponsive to representative democracy. We value representative democracy. Via the current set up, we are bound to a political moment from decades ago with no recourse.  It seems the weakest checks and balances are on SCOTUS."
20,"My opponent is so radical and out of touch he voted against a bill that Joni Ernst, who has taken millions from the NRA, voted for. https://t.co/m1uiBf6GMl"
21,"The Roe reversal has given people license to really show us who they are, both good and bad. But I‚Äôll admit, I never expected to see a sitting U.S. Senator say out loud he wants to go after Brown vs. Board.  Terrifying.  It‚Äôs another call to action."
22,It was great spending the evening talking with a packed room with my friend and our next Governor @DeidreDeJear in Elk Horn! https://t.co/leVpOupqUq
23,@DeidreDeJear It was great to see you!
24,"RT @cjforiowa: I used to avoid wearing #pride attire in my small town (pop. 327), thinking it best not to stir the pot.

29,@ChadPrenatt Terrible.

32,It was an honor to speak in support of women‚Äôs reproductive rights and demanding our basic rights without hesitation in Sioux City this evening. https://t.co/o8uGgi6Cgp

34,"There‚Äôs much to say and do, but for now, I‚Äôll just say to women that I recognize you live in a much scarier country now, that the gravity of this day is probably suffocating right now.    We love you, but know words aren‚Äôt enough. I will keep fighting the good fight."

50,@piper4missouri Definitely LGBTQ+ issues.

56,@DisabilityC_IA You‚Äôre welcome!
57,@DisabilityC_IA Hello!  My speech is on my Twitter a day or two back. :)
58,"@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack No one‚Äôs ever pointed a gun in my face before taking it.  We can simply raise the tax cap to better fund it. I think in the land of plenty, it‚Äôs the right program to fund to ensure the well being of our people."
59,"@BigmamaDolcea Nah, I‚Äôll keep doing my part to make it the best it can be. :)"
60,@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack It‚Äôs an insurance pool. Similar to car insurance or home insurance. It‚Äôs protection against future risk. It‚Äôs a program designed to ensure vast swaths of people aren‚Äôt left homeless and without an ability to care for themselves.  It‚Äôs saved millions of lives. Not a Ponzi scheme.
61,@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack We can agree on one thing. We incarcerate far too many people.
62,@MarcoBattaglia @SMT_Solvers @RickStewart I‚Äôm always going to support all candidates getting the chance to debate. It‚Äôs what the people deserve.
63,"@Alejbkr Do you really think per what you see in my Twitter that I pander, considering the context of the district I‚Äôm running in?  I tell the truth and do what I think the right thing is to do, regardless of votes."
64,"@Alejbkr You realize what district I‚Äôm in, right?"
65,"My speech at the convention yesterday was timely.  We can‚Äôt claim to be the party of the people, that we  do the right things for the right reasons, and at the same time say we need to abandon or deprioritize certain types of people to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.  Human rights are non-negotiable."
66,"@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack The comparison doesn‚Äôt hold water and is offensive. You haven‚Äôt spoken to any of my points. Go ahead and call for the defunding of the police, military,  social security, and then you can really show me you‚Äôre ‚Äúpure capitalist.‚Äù  Til then, your ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù boogeyman falls apart."
67,@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack Socialism and Nazism are not the same thing. I can‚Äôt believe I actually have to type that. Come on now.
68,"@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack We have a mixed economy. Some socialistic elements, some capitalistic elements. You know that."
69,"@SMT_Solvers @polkdems @rasforiowa @IAEthicsBoard It seems like you‚Äôre just using a lot of sleight of hand combined with some disparate references and a zig zag of connections to create a muddled picture that confuses, but I see no connection to Deidre in any of it."
70,@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack You should google ‚Äúcholera‚Äù if you‚Äôre going to speak of private vs. public funding of infrastructure. Or the ‚ÄúGreat Depression‚Äù perhaps. You‚Äôre really making an argument that we were better in those spaces in the early 1900‚Äôs before federal income taxes and programs?
71,@SMT_Solvers @polkdems @rasforiowa She is not referenced in this article.
72,"@KCRPH @SMT_Solvers @TysonFoods @jessvilsack Socialists, huh?  You‚Äôre completely against socialism? I assume you‚Äôd define that as the funding of a program by tax payer money and run by the government?  So you‚Äôre for defunding the police, military, fire department, &amp; social security?  No need for the boogeyman sloganeering."
73,"@SMT_Solvers @MarcoBattaglia @RickStewart The primary was literally two weeks ago. Let‚Äôs be reasonable. But yeah, I certainly would encourage her to debate, just as I‚Äôd encourage my opponent to debate me."
74,"@SMT_Solvers @polkdems @rasforiowa I like Ras a lot. Beyond that, you can always share/cite a source of some kind if you‚Äôd like to."
75,"@TravisSchlenger Yep, I‚Äôve been very outspoken regarding those issues as well."
76,"The audio of my state convention speech yesterday, where I call on Democrats to fight for our friends and family in the LGBTQ+ community without hesitation. https://t.co/3j9dOwbisW"
77,"I really think Deidre DeJear is a once in a generation candidate. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of hearing her in person many times, and I always walk away with the same thought. It‚Äôd be a damn shame if we wasted her gift by not doing what‚Äôs needed to get her in office."
78,@BrianMcLain15 Yesterday was a hectic day so no worries at all. Congrats on your win!  And definitely.
79,"Hey all! There will be no FB live this evening, as today‚Äôs dedicated to my boys."
80,"I hope you all have joyful Juneteenth holiday.  It‚Äôs a day to celebrate freedom won, and to steel ourselves to defend freedom under threat."
81,@TJKELLYIA @cjforiowa @iowademocrats I just posted it to my Twitter page. :)
82,The transcript of my speech at the state convention yesterday. https://t.co/ZN9ozuCf2l
83,"@MuellerSheWrote This is the primary thing I‚Äôve taken away from the January 6th hearings.  Well, that and why Eastman thought SCOTUS wouldn‚Äôt touch the Pence piece of the plot."
84,@PDunnChandler I'm blocking you for homophobia.  That groomer claim is not going to fly here.
85,"@ChronicHope_DC @AvidaLectrix Sexual violence is dramatic underreported, so we don‚Äôt know the true stat on that.  We‚Äôll just have to disagree, as I can‚Äôt imagine forcing a woman to give birth in that situation."
86,"@ChronicHope_DC @LangeChristy I adopted my youngest. It is beautiful.  It is also very expensive with a lot of accessibility concerns. And again, this doesn‚Äôt address the fact it forces women to endure a pregnancy against their will if adoption and forced birth are the only two solutions being proposed."
87,"@ChronicHope_DC @AvidaLectrix There‚Äôs a glaring omission here. First, the omission seems to suggest you aren‚Äôt accounting for sexual violence resulting in pregnancy.  Second, you flat out are saying women don‚Äôt have control over their bodies the entire pregnancy.  That‚Äôs frightening."
88,"@cynic_idealist I certainly am not, as I‚Äôve said elsewhere in replies to the original thread."
89,@ChronicHope_DC @AvidaLectrix You‚Äôre saying a woman has no agency here.  You‚Äôre saying a woman has no right to prevent her own death during pregnancy.  Abortion is not murder. Leaving a woman unable to protect herself from avoidable death sounds more like that.
90,"@cynic_idealist I‚Äôm certainly not doing that. Criminalization if abortion certainly would do that, though."
91,@PDunnChandler A simple google search will show you otherwise.
92,"@ChronicHope_DC Science absolutely does not agree with you.  But let‚Äôs extend your argument out logically.  You‚Äôre using a ‚Äúpotential for life = life‚Äù argument.  If you extend that logic far, it falls apart."
93,@broodwars64 I‚Äôve also replied to that question in another reply to the original thread.
94,@broodwars64 I‚Äôve already done so on other replies to the original post.
95,@ChronicHope_DC @AvidaLectrix Abortion is not murder.
96,"@broodwars64 I don‚Äôt really think this merits a response, other than my ask for you to do some research as to the consequences abortion bans have on all women, including those that don‚Äôt pursue abortion."
97,@Mattmanver2 Abortion isn‚Äôt murder.  I‚Äôve already replied to this though on another reply to this thread.
98,"@Alejbkr @jmwiebke I‚Äôm going to control what I can and do the right things for the right reasons.  If I win, great.  If I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be at peace, and I‚Äôll keep fighting the good fight regardless."
99,@MaxSpastic We‚Äôre going to stay and keep fighting the good fight.
