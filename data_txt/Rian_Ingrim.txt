1,@RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Your a true patriot. Can we turn Nevada?
2,Let's get ready for the fireworks. Get your popcorn ready.
3,"@stoolpresidente Dave, thank you for supporting small businesses with your fund. We're holding a rally to open up the city of Yelm here in Washington State. Would be very grateful for any support from you, to include speaking. The event will be January 9th."
4,Our justice system around the country is disgraceful.
5,@InfidelAngela Where did they get the time to practice?
6,@InfidelAngela Is this happening during hospital hours? Thought the media was telling us that hospitals were at max capacity? How could the healthcare workers have time for this? Maybe there in another section of the hospital?
7,"RT @JerryFetta: The Parable of The $600 Stimulus Check. ðŸ˜œ

Don't rely on unreliable resources when it comes to finances.

9,@RealWayneRoot Preach it. No fans at rose bowl is a disgrace. Tired of this fear mongering BS.
10,Would be great if the media in general reported the news.
11,@SpeakerPelosi Gross
12,We're is Gina Haspel?
13,No mandatory vaccines. Americans fought for our freedoms so we make our own decisions and not those forced on us from the Govt.
14,The corruption is unbelievable!
15,All this fear mongering is unnecessary.
16,@nightscouter @Satchmo65682368 @SpeakerPelosi @GOP I'm arguing the fact that the speaker is creating fear.
17,"@SpeakerPelosi Actually Nancy the numbers are more like 416,800 american troops died in WWII and 418,500 American civilians. Nice try though."
18,@ChefGruel @LaurenGruel That looks fantastic
19,"@GerardKapraun Hahahaha, that's so true"
20,@Jack_Hawks @Suzette29488584 @redrn666 @shesgotgame16 @funder I guess we should all just do what the GOVT. says and not question anything. Stay in our homes and not live life.
21,@redrn666 @Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder I live my life not in fear.
22,@redrn666 @Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder Your hoping others get covid? Wow.
23,"@redrn666 @Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder Your right, the head ER doc who helped set up javits in New York isn't a doctor. Got it. Enjoy living your life in fear."
24,"@WetzelDee @funder That sounds great, how is he bring the country together? Why hasn't Biden condemned antifa?"
25,@LarsLarsonShow Absolutely Lars.
26,@RealWayneRoot Absolute hypocrites. Open up our country.
27,"@Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder So doctors and nurses are wrong? Are you a health professional? I'm not the one saying it. Health professionals are. If you like living in fear, enjoy yourself. I don't."
28,@Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder I have. Know many nurses and ER docs. All the docs I talk with throughout the country say it's a bad flu. Have you heard different? I've been to the hospitals as well. Have you or do you just listen to news?
29,@Jack_Hawks @shesgotgame16 @funder Haven't heard of any flu/heart/stroke/cancer deaths only china virus. Don't you think that is interesting? How about hospitals where patients are down? Have you looked at the numbers?
30,@L1beralTexan @shesgotgame16 @funder Bbbbbbbaaaaaaaahahaha
31,@shesgotgame16 @funder Bbbbbbbaaaaaaaahahaha
32,@LarsLarsonShow Keep doing your thing Lars. Love the show.

35,@RealWayneRoot Keep preaching the truth Wayne
36,"@RealWayneRoot Bill ""deep state"" Barr is in on it. Has been from the start. No regard for the law."
37,@Judy84812827 @LarsLarsonShow Nobody said the republican SOS's aren't corrupt.
38,@bennyjohnson @bfraser747 We all knew he was in cahoots with Mueller.
39,@LarsLarsonShow If the rampant cheating ever stopped and the SOS/AG office get audited.
40,"Bill ""deep state"" Barr, get some balls and do your job!!"

43,@GodF1r5t @realDonaldTrump @OANN @dougducey He was paid off like the rest of them. Shameful.
