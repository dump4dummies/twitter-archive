Drug trials, adverse event monitoring, and statistical analysis of efficacy before drug approval is granted keeps us safe."
82,@jeremymunson @ourhealthmn @NSmithholt12 Your statement that the government refuses to negotiate with pharma is not entirely accurate.  E.g. the VA negotiated down the price of HepC from $90k down to $28k and has cured 100k veterans. You say you don't trust our own government to set prices for you...

I would call ceasefire a success for the 12 days, but it hasn't impacted yearly numbers for sure."
96,"@EyesonYou410 @jemillerwbal I haven't see the actual data, but reading the study it looks solid. You have to remember that the ceasefires are only 12 days out of 365/366 days in a year. That's only 3% of the year. At this point they are positive blips, but need to identify why they work."

98,"@jemillerwbal Here is a link to the data analysis study. Why does Baltimore Ceasefire 365 work? Are more people on the streets and therefore perpetrators are more visible and less likely to do bad things? Or is everybody just deciding the need a break? 

https://t.co/clGZCVtLE2"
99,@MDsteve24 @jemillerwbal So I just read the study and there are ~6000 data points between 2012 and 2019. That's a good sampling. One of the charts clearly shows downward spikes during each of the cease fire weekends. The question is why does this cease fire work? Are more people are on the streets? https://t.co/BhACGNlKtX
