0,"For the right, it takes a rigged election and covert FBI operations to get a little rowdy.

For the left, every time there's news or a legal decision that doesn't go their way they're out in the streets rioting and burning things down.

Yet they say that we're in a cult."
1,Name a classic story that would transform nicely into an epic space adventure.
2,@nypost This company keeps proving over and over they are pure evil. I really hope their stock tanks to junk level.
3,"@BenHolden_28 @LisaPurdue2 @RepShontelBrown You aren't burdened with an over abundance of intelligence, are you?"
4,"@RepShontelBrown One is a Constitutional right, the other isn't. As a Rep. I am saddened to see that you are ignorant of the difference."
5,"@Alpha_AED Thank you, Missouri for protecting American babies."
6,@valdemings And you will lose.
7,@WhiteHouse I'll be sure to miss that just like every other remarks he's mumbled to the press.
8,@SpeakerPelosi Oh like California is going to ban abortions. You sick bastards will probably incentivize it. Kill your unborn and get a $500 Walmart gift card.
9,"@Logically_JC The right to murder babies? Good riddance. Well, good riddance in the States that choose to protect life. I'm sure all the evil Democrat States will make sure you can kill as many babies as you want.  They'll probably even incentivize it.  Murder your unborn child and get $500."
10,GOD what a glorious day! The liberal meltdown is so thick it's almost as sweet as if Trump was reinstated as the real winner of the 2020 elections.
11,@MagaRisingJohn Yes!!! American lives must be protected.
12,"@robreiner No, we WERE being tyrannized by a Globalist minority. Now we're finally moving in the right direction to restore the Constitutional Republic."
13,"@BuffalosMom Unfortunately, he had no chance of succeeding. The swamp is too deep and there was no one he could really trust. He was backstabbed more times than any other President. What he did accomplish though was exposing just how bad things were."
14,"@Sparkle31888597 What are you talking about? This is exactly what we have now. A bunch of Globalist elitists on both sides running the country's economy into the ground to usher in their New World Order, and neither you nor I are on their list of people who will benefit."
15,"@danno1130 @StephsMundo @TashaMahal @B52Malmet How many were killed in Uvalde in June? 19. 
How many were killed in Chicago in June?
June to Date
Shot &amp; Killed: 47
Shot &amp; Wounded: 219
Total Shot: 266
Total Homicides: 50"
16,"@LuvLansing @RepSwalwell I have ZERO interest in reading anything from an account named Anti-Fascist with less than 40 followers.  Burn in hell, you bot."
17,"@joncoopertweets Your forgot to include ""and wiser"". Some people, like you, are born dumb and remain dumb."
18,"@AmericanDHer 2nd Amendment win today, Abortion win tomorrow... what a great week!"
19,@ReefSixtyNine69 @FandM_GTO_1969 @POTUS Can't say it. Twitter will ban me.
20,"@kreme_puff @5CitiesV @davidcharns @8NewsNow @GKnapp @FBI If you're talking about the whole geolocation not being accurate thing, that debunking has been debunked. 2000 Mules is spot on accurate."
21,"@danno1130 @StephsMundo @TashaMahal @B52Malmet And where do the majority of those gun deaths occur? Dem controlled cities like NY, Chicago, L.A. and Houston. Go live in the boonies near a bunch of rednecks and it's one of the quietest and safest places you could imagine. Damn good BBQs too."
22,"@StephsMundo @TashaMahal @B52Malmet You don't really travel much, do you?"
23,@TashaMahal @B52Malmet You're right. That's not enough guns.
24,@B52Malmet You live in a country where you have the right to protect your children WITH a gun.
25,"@Ur_a_Smartass_C White people in the US, yes.  White people in the UK, not so much."
26,@robreiner The Supreme Court just made protecting yourself from evil more convenient. Feel free to move somewhere where they are stripping people of the right to defend themselves and their family. Canada is a good option.
27,"@RepSwalwell Does anyone actually vote for this id10t, or are ALL his votes fraudulent?"
28,"@LuvLansing @RepSwalwell Nope. Election was rigged. Has been for decades. Dems just made it go their way in 2020. They just made it painfully obvious they were doing it. Everyone with an IQ higher than their shoe size was like, ""Wait a minute. This shit ain't right."""
29,@catturd2 @RepSwalwell Exactly!
30,"@RepSwalwell I'll take ""Things that never happened"" for 1000, Alex."
31,@JohnStefaniFI Truth! https://t.co/99oHMP5cvx
32,"@dbongino Morning, Dan!"
33,@TheRealHershe @realArmandKlein $$$ Chaching! $$$
34,My account was suspended for 12 hours yesterday for this: https://t.co/5Y0aKpbP0G
35,"@CMWooly @johnnybingonyc @MeSunrise1 @joncoopertweets There is no cult. There are just people who love their country and don't want to see it turned into a third world country via unfettered immigration, lawlessness and the Globalist agenda to diminish our power on the world stage."
36,"@Cernovich This, boys and girls, is what is called gaslighting."
37,@POTUS Great Depression 2.0 here we come.
38,@ArmyBrat682 We don't behead the totalitarian elite like France did in 1792.
39,@sandsun4me @joncoopertweets You mean about 20 million real people and 61 million fake people.
40,"@MeSunrise1 @joncoopertweets I'll take things that never happened for 500, Alex."
41,@joncoopertweets Nope! F* Off with that farce and complete waste of taxpayer money.
42,@knucklefuker Yes! Imagine thinking about robbing a convenience store when you are fairly certain that half the people in the store are packing.
43,@knucklefuker Star Trek even had a solution to the Sir and Ma'am issue. Just call every officer Sir regardless of sex... or gender identification.
44,"@DBistoli @senorheatmiser @POTUS You wrote that in all lower case. That's not a convincing statement. However, you tell yourself whatever you need to in order to sleep better at night. If only everyone would keep masking and social distancing, right?"
45,@SincerelyBashar @POTUS This must be a satire account.
46,@POTUS I don't know a single parent that has been anticipating giving their small child a vaccine that causes untreatable long term heart conditions for a virus that is no longer being talked about in the news and the current symptoms are extremely minor.
47,@lovewins20201 @WeAre_Investing @marcorubio LOL You are so funny. Have a great day.
48,"@GoldieH34757900 Biden did just say there was going to be another pandemic. Monkey pox wasn't spreading like they were hoping, so here comes plan P (for Polio)."
49,I am increasingly convinced that I am arguing with people who have incorrect information using information that is equally as incorrect. We're all being lied to.
50,"@karenroepke @nana53 @Psu7893 @marcorubio Is there still oil in the fields where those idle pump jacks are? Serious question, I'm not trying to be a smartass. I think we're all being kept in the dark on what's really going on."
51,"@asbestos @Psu7893 @marcorubio Correct. The thing is, we don't even use much of what we drill ourselves. That is mostly exported. However, that puts pressure on OPEC to keep the production up and prices low to remain competitive."
52,@Dawn73Nigel @Psu7893 @marcorubio I have to agree with you that the drilling permit issue is just a smoke screen.
53,@DianeAdamson9 @Dawn73Nigel @Psu7893 @marcorubio Huge points for the correct word usage. I don't think that's the answer though. There's a lot more at play than we're being told. This whole 2030 timeline that's been pushed up keeps eating at me. What aren't they telling us?
54,@WeAre_Investing @marcorubio I am a huge fan of nuclear energy. Molten Salt Thorium reactors are the way we should be going. I completely agree with you about the grid.
55,"@lovewins20201 @WeAre_Investing @marcorubio The only thing you finished was convincing me that you are stupid. Didn't need to do that, though, I was pretty clear you were from the get go."
56,"@lovewins20201 @Psu7893 @marcorubio prospect
1. n. [Geology]

An area of exploration in which hydrocarbons have been predicted to exist in economic quantity. A prospect is commonly an anomaly, such as a geologic structure or a seismic amplitude anomaly, that is recommended by explorationists for drilling a well."
57,"@nana53 @Psu7893 @marcorubio Come back when you research beyond a MSM headline. They've already stated those 9,000 ""idle"" leases aren't idle. They are on land where they didn't find oil."
58,"@Psu7893 @marcorubio Well, I guess the pressure finally made these idiots cave.  Too late to save them from the slaughter they are about to receive in the House and the Senate. Not that it matters anyway. All different sides of the same coin."
59,"@CharlieCrist Not a chance in F*ing hell, Charlie!"
60,Truth Social is a waste of fucking time.
61,"@RebeccaPremo @catturd2 3rd party candidates will ONLY win at small local elections. Federal elections are tightly controlled through lobby groups and PACs. Once in a while you get someone who is not an insider to sneak through like MTG and Boebert, but they have no shot of making any real change."
62,"@WeAre_Investing @marcorubio Biden has no interest in increasing the refining capacity here in the US. In fact, he wants exactly the opposite to push his ""green"" energy agenda."
63,"@synphilter @marcorubio Do you do ANY research? Like, even just a little bit? This was in response to the oil glut during the COVID pandemic lockdowns. It was the appropriate response at the time."
64,@Psu7893 @marcorubio To your point 3) - the POTUS dictates the policy on allowing oil companies to prospect for oil on Government land. This POTUS has flat out rejected any new oil prospecting.
65,"2020 was a fraudulent election. So was 2016, 2012, 2008, 2004, 2000..."
66,@Daytobehappy Yep. The Non-Player Character army (aka programmed leftists) is out in force.
67,"@MeKaytoo @amyklobuchar It was used in their favor in 2020, so it's all good."
68,"@amyklobuchar What you mean to say is that there are plenty of us out there that are sick of the rigged elections and there will be a point when we take a real stand, not the fake ""insurrection"" that was nothing more than an FBI operation."
69,"@ProgressiveTex After seeing your bio I would expect nothing different from you. You are a shell of a person who is incapable of intelligent, independent thought. You are the equivalent of a Non-Player Character in a video game. You are a program."
70,@catturd2 The system is rigged to keep it a two party system. There is no chance for a third party to succeed.
71,@AVindman You are a disgrace to your uniform. It sickens me to see you wear it.
72,@JohnStefaniFI A-freaking-men.
73,"@cmcgraw626 Typical leftist strategy - deny everything, call the truth B.S. and attack those questioning any of it. I was merely stating a fact."
74,"@ProgressiveTex What disinformation are you talking about? I merely stated facts about an announced water pipe leak that caused a delay in vote counting. Did it happen or not? But to your point, if thousands of fraudulent ballots are mixed in with real ballots a recount will never change that."
75,@POTUS Those who find refuge in America are probably regretting it under this dummy's regime
76,@ericswalwell You're calling the wrong witnesses.
77,"Correction to the event - it occurred election morning, not in the evening.  It resulted in a pause in absentee ballot counting from 5:30 AM to 9:30 AM"
78,"On the evening of Nov 3rd it was announced that a water pipe had broken in State Farm arena in Fulton County, GA causing ballot counting to stop. What company was called in to fix the broken water pipe? The receipt for the repairs should be attainable through FOIA."
79,@d2fl I'll check them out.
80,"@ttstrac @ericswalwell He's part of the Globalist agenda. Sadly, he ain't going anywhere."
81,"@StephenKing Abortion is not preventative birth control, it is murder. Abortion steals the opportunity for a beautiful soul to enter into this world and possibly make a difference."
82,"@ericswalwell You are part of the problem and we will fight you, your lies and your Globalist agenda of hatred and the destruction of American values with every fiber of our bodies."
83,What ever happened to movies that have a good moral to the story? When I am rich I will create a film production company that brings that back. I will create an anti-Hollywood right here in Florida.
84,"@1True_American_ I would have no choice. My moral compass wouldn't let me just be a bystander. I'd probably get my ass kicked, but at least I'd sleep better at night knowing I didn't just stand there or pull out my phone and start filming."
85,@joncoopertweets You are fooling yourself. The system is rigged to keep the Globalists in power.
86,"@JoeBiden Don't mess with our kids!! Your sick, pedophile agenda will be stopped. You are the enemy of American families."
87,"@JackLee67459269 @OSILVA69208918 I know, right? 80F when I was a kid, I'd be out riding my bike, climbing hills... 80F now I'm out for 30 minutes max usually doing yard work and then I'm inside with the AC blasting and a cold drink to cool down."
88,"@caroljsroth Democrats make stuff up to be popular amongst stupid voters. Stupid voters want the rich to pay their ""fair share"" of taxes without understanding A) How much rich people actually pay in taxes and B) What this wealth tax actually means"
89,"@Bevlar15 I am part of tge working class and I think my tax rate is pretty fair, especially when compared to how much tax I would be paying if I lived in another country like Germany.  My tax rate in Germany would be 54%! I turned down a job offer because of that."
90,"@KatimaMoo @RSAGC @ModestyQueen19 @kr8tr Fact: At the height of slavery there were 350,000 slaves mostly owned by southern Democrat plantation owners. Another 350,000 immigrated to the US as free men. Chances are good if you're black your ancestors were never slaves in the US."
91,"@Erickson4IL It's not that hot here... OK it's that hot here, but you have pools, the beach and AC."
92,"@Erickson4IL See, Cheryl, don't you wish you lived in Florida?"
93,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but you probably don't visit that place often enough to make the monthly subscription worth it. Stop wasting your money."
94,"@ruthbeall14 Indeed. You save money in one place and they just charge you more in another to compensate. The only way it becomes really worth it is if you add battery storage. Otherwise when everyone else loses power, so do I."
95,Electric companies go through an approval process before they can increase rates per KwH for their customers. Florida Power and Light found a way to increase costs for solar customers without needing approval. They introduced a Minimum Base Bill. My FPL bills are now double.
96,@ThatDubiousCat @TimRunsHisMouth @robreiner They don't have to say it. The elections have been rigged for decades.
97,"@robreiner Hey, meathead, we are not a Democracy.  We are a Constitutional Republic and you Hollywood Marxists keep trying to destroy that."
98,"@alexstein99 @WangHangLo1 @tedcruz I appreciate your intent but this approach accomplishes nothing. He’s never going to say, “You know what? You are right. I will change my corrupt, globalist ways.”"
