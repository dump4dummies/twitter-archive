https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
11,"As we fight to win back women‚Äôs freedom to control their own bodies and make their own health care decisions, never forget that #ExtremistElise Stefanik voted AGAINST the Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act. The choice this November is clear. #NY21"
12,"Last night we grieved and protested. Today we fight back against extremists. Every election from here on out is an opportunity to fight back. And we will not stop until we win. Together, we will win back our freedoms. I‚Äôll be fighting with you every step of the way. #NY21 https://t.co/8mBgtNqrEd"

20,"When we don‚Äôt have enough child care and elder care, the burden almost always falls on women, impacting careers and future earning potential. Let‚Äôs support upstate women to realize their dreams while knowing their families are safe and cared for."
21,I demand that @RepStefanik @EliseStefanik answer to #NY21 voters whether she knowingly broke the law and coordinated with Representative Mo Brooks and others to seek a pardon. My statement: https://t.co/31GNfycISv
22,"""It's now up to every American now &amp; in the future to stand for for truth, to reject the lies, wherever we confront them: In our towns. In our capitals. In our friendships. In our families. And at the ballot box. And within our own minds and hearts."" Rep. Kinzinger"
23,Who are the unnamed others who requested preemptive pardons? #January6thCommittee
24,"‚ÄúWhen you damage our fundamental institutions, it‚Äôs not easy to repair them.‚Äù - Hon. Jeff Rosen. This is what is at stake in these hearings: the strength of our fundamental institutions and the future of our elections. #January6thCommittee"
25,‚ÄúPure insanity‚Äù that people in the White House and at the highest levels were spreading debunked conspiracy theories.  #January6thCommitteeHearings
26,"Many of us would like to know if Elise Stefanik was at the meetings discussing how to overturn the election, even after being told there was no evidence of fraud. #January6thCommitteeHearings"
27,"‚ÄúSomebody should be put in charge at the DOJ who isn‚Äôt frightened what‚Äôs going to be done to their reputation.‚Äù - Rudy Giuliani 

In reality, it must be someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to stand up for what‚Äôs right. DOJ must be free from political interference. #January6thCommittee"
28,‚ÄúJust say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen‚Äù That‚Äôs not how we choose our leaders in America. #Jan6thCommittee
29,It‚Äôs disturbing to hear Members of Congress support overturning the will of the people based on what they knew to be lies. We know that Elise Stefanik was one of them. In November she will be held accountable. #Jan6thCommittee
30,"So far, the #Jan6thCommittee hearings are demonstrating the intensity of the campaign to bend the will of the Justice Department to the President‚Äôs political will. It takes strong people to stand up to your own party under that kind of pressure."
31,Imagine a future where the President could screen applicants to the Justice Department with one question: are you loyal to the constitution or to me? Chilling. #January6thCommittee
32,The Attorney General is the People‚Äôs lawyer. Asking them to ignore facts is not the norm. #January6thCommittee
33,"We are fortunate to have had so many principled civil servants who stood up for our constitution or, in Bill Barr‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure we would have had a transition at all‚Äù. #January6thCommitteeHearings"
34,"As we learn about the efforts to pressure the Justice Department, remember, it is our Justice Department, they work on behalf of the American people, not a President or a political agenda. #Jan6thCommittee"
35,More #January6thCommitteeHearings starting now. I‚Äôll be listening and live tweeting. On Tuesday we learned about the terror unleashed on civil servants and election officials who stood up for our voting rights. What do you think we‚Äôll learn today?

https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"

https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
41,"Every step of the way, #ExtremistElise Stefanik has OPPOSED green energy jobs, prioritizing her Big Oil donors over the people and the needs of our district. We deserve a representative who will unleash our clean energy potential, not stifle it."
42,"Help me defeat Elise Stefanik and deliver real results for Upstate New York.
https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
43,"I will support green energy development in #NY21 to bring good paying, stable jobs, and investments in skills training for this and other industries to build a robust pipeline of talent so our local businesses can grow and thrive. We deserve secure jobs and a strong workforce."

https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
46,"Every step of the way, #ExtremistElise has OPPOSED bringing investments in broadband and cell service to #NY21, preventing us from unleashing our full potential. We deserve a representative who understands what we need to thrive."
47,RT @PatRyanUC: My name is Pat Ryan. I‚Äôm the Democratic nominee for Congress in the special election for NY-19. This is the *LAST* competiti‚Ä¶
48,"Help me defeat Elise Stefanik and deliver real results for Upstate New York.
https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
49,We need to treat rural broadband and cell service like rural electrification - it‚Äôs a matter of public safety and a necessity that we prioritize because everyone deserves to be able to access the tools of the 21st century.
50,"I am struck by the rampant abuse of power, the courageous people who stood up for our Constitution &amp; the people‚Äôs right to choose our leaders, and those who didn‚Äôt. The attacks against election workers and civil servants continues. We must have accountability. #Jan6thCommittee"
51,"Death threats and racist comments just for doing her job. People terrorized Ms. Moss, her mother, her grandmother, and her child, taking away their safety and security. And now all of the election workers from Fulton County have left out of fear. It‚Äôs despicable. #January6th"
52,Hearing Ms. Moss talk about the importance of the right to vote in her family and her love for helping older voters exercise their right to vote is very moving. They destroyed this woman‚Äôs career with lies and put her and her mother‚Äôs lives under threat. #Jan6thCommitteeHearings
53,"The threats against Secretary Raffensperger‚Äôs family, including his widowed daughter-in-law, are absolutely unAmerican. In America, we don‚Äôt decide our elections by violence. #January6thCommitteeHearings #January6th"
54,https://t.co/hxXYuL1ndK
55,"Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger did his due diligence to make sure the 2020 election was counted correctly, and law enforcement investigated their false claims and found nothing. Still, Elise Stefanik continued to make wildly inaccurate claims about Georgia‚Äôs election."
56,"The president may have been the biggest promoter of lies about the election, but he wasn‚Äôt alone. Elise Stefanik and others were happy to lie for him and for their own self-promotion with no concern for the consequences. #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6Committee"
57,People work incredibly hard to manage our elections and count votes. It is unacceptable to threaten these folks because you don‚Äôt like the outcome of an election. People at the very highest levels encouraged violence based on a lie. #January6thCommitteeHearings
58,I remember @GabrielSterling‚Äôs emotional plea to the President to stop the lies and end the violence. There were so many opportunities to stop this and good people trying to bring reason. #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6thCommitteeHearings
59,This is some very powerful testimony from Speaker Bowers: ‚ÄúI do not want to be a winner by cheating.‚Äù - Rep. Bowers. #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6thCommittee
60,The fake electors scheme was illegal and designed to try to con the American people into believing that it wasn‚Äôt clear who won the election even though they knew otherwise. ‚ÄúA tragic parody‚Äù - Rep. Bowers. #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6thCommittee
61,I am grateful to ‚ÄúTeam Normal‚Äù for walking away from these illegal schemes to steal the election. It‚Äôs very disappointing to have a representative in Elise Stefanik who remains ‚ÄúTeam Big Lie‚Äù. #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6thCommittee
62,I agree with Speaker Bowers that the peaceful transfer of power and following the outcome of the will of the people is sacred in America. #January6th #January6thCommitteeHearings #Jan6thCommittee
63,Speaker Bowers is absolutely right that choosing our leaders is a right belonging to the people. We should all be grateful that his faith in and allegiance to our Constitution was greater than party. It‚Äôs a standard we should hold all electeds to. #Jan6thCommittee
64,"GOP speaker of the Arizona House, Rusty Bowers, is very clear that there was no election fraud in his state. They wanted to replace presidential electors not because they weren‚Äôt legitimate, but because they didn‚Äôt like the outcome. #Jan6Committee"
65,The violent threats toward GOP and Dem. elected officials who stood up for the will of the people are unacceptable. It‚Äôs a testament to local law enforcement that nobody was injured or killed but I suspect we are going to find out that their lives and work will never be the same.
66,"The idea that State Legislatures and not the people get to choose our leaders is clearly unconstitutional, and fundamentally unAmerican. #January6thCommittee"
67,"If people in the White House and in the US government were involved in a ‚Äúconspiracy to defraud the United States‚Äù, that‚Äôs a conspiracy against us. The American people deserve the truth. #January6thCommittee"
68,"‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt see any evidence of fraud‚Äù - Bill Barr. There was no basis for election fraud claims, yet Elise Stefanik continues to spread lies that the 2020 election results can‚Äôt be trusted while she stays silent about threats against secretaries of state &amp; election workers."
69,"The recent attempt in New Mexico to stop election certification is a chilling reminder that #January6th also wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident. These are our elections, not theirs to overturn and we must make sure our right to choose our leaders is protected."
70,"Today, the #Jan6thCommittee will be showing that the pressure on Mike Pence to overturn our election wasn't an isolated incident, election officials across the country faced threats of violence and still stood up for our elections."
71,"Help me defeat Elise Stefanik and deliver real results for Upstate New York.
https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
72,"I will make expanding quality affordable broadband and cell service in #NY21 a top priority so kids can do their homework at home (not in parking lots), businesses and workers can compete, and seniors can stay connected."
73,"The #January6thCommittee hearing starts at 1pm, I‚Äôll be live tweeting. Last week, we learned that the election deniers knew they were lying and knew that asking VP Pence not to certify was a violation of our constitution. What do you think we‚Äôll learn today?"
74,"Everyone in #NY21 ‚Äì from students to small business owners ‚Äì deserve access to the basic tools of the 21st century like broadband and cell service. This investment  will pay for itself many times over by making it easier to go to school, start a business, or take a remote job."
75,"Help us defeat Elise Stefanik and make #NY21 a place where everyone can thrive. Chip in whatever you can here:
https://t.co/6GMYSArrwf"
76,"Let‚Äôs come together and make #NY21 a place where you can go to school, build a career, grow a business, raise a family, and retire in comfort."
77,"We know here in #NY21 that the jobs recovery has been uneven, and we need investments in our economic future right now to give us all the financial security we deserve. That‚Äôs what I will prioritize in Congress. https://t.co/vcl05dJzhC"
78,"Every step of the way, #ExtremistElise has OPPOSED investments that would bring good paying jobs and help businesses grow in #NY21, instead lining the pockets of her out of district donors. She‚Äôs hurting our workforce and our local businesses."
79,"Elise Stefanik is a clear and present danger to democracy at home and abroad. I stand with @NEDemocracy staff who are livid at Stefanik‚Äôs embrace and defense of #January6th criminals, undermining democratic values everywhere. She should be removed from NED &amp; voted out of office. https://t.co/SJMdxOy4rZ"
80,"A strong job market is only strong if you have access to the jobs you need, and businesses have a pipeline of workers to fill them. We can create a strong job market right here in upstate New York. #NY21"
81,"Investments in the people of #NY21 make our communities strong. I will always bet on you and your unlimited potential. Read more about my priorities to bring good paying jobs to upstate New York.

82,Had a great afternoon meeting with voters in Glens Falls at the @LARAC_ARTS June Arts Fest. Folks from across the political spectrum are ready for a change - and we‚Äôre going to deliver it for all of #NY21. https://t.co/sKUqZ4PVIN
83,"Early voting is happening right now across #NY21 to choose who will be on your Nov. ballot for Gov, Lt. Gov, &amp; Assembly - the 1st of 2 primaries this year.

84,"Hey everyone, it‚Äôs #MensHealthWeek. I ran 2.5 miles this am (in honor of #Juneteenth). I stay healthy with strength training &amp; cardio and getting regular check ups, even when I feel good. Prevention saves lives. And a workout means I get to eat more burgersüçî. https://t.co/bURwv6rt3J"
85,"Today we celebrate #Juneteenth when in 1865, almost 2.5 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, enslaved people in Texas were brought news of their freedom. Americans of every race and every background know that freedom is too precious to delay or deny."

95,"Elise Stefanik OPPOSED bringing down prescription drug costs, protecting her pharmaceutical company donors profits instead of the American people, all for her own political gain. She sees Americans in pain as a career opportunity. We know American families deserve a break. #NY21"
96,"Yesterday, the bill to expand health care and disability benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic waste passed the Senate. #ExtremistElise Stefanik voted against it in the House. Her record on veterans is terrible. #PACTAct"
97,I worked helping veterans and vulnerable seniors get access to the quality care and services they needed. I will do the same for everyone in #NY21.
98,"From infants to seniors, we deserve quality care that‚Äôs affordable and available. Making sure we and our loved ones can get the care we need when we need it means our families are safer, more secure, and stronger. #NY21"
99,"I wish Elise Stefanik treated American energy like she does milk in schools - we need options, not to be held hostage to Big Oil. #NY21"
