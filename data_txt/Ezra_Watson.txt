18,"@WilFiacco @wink1radio There is great health insurance available up here through union collective bargaining, like through CSEA, I get it. That is the main group against the NY Health Act. I bet you spoke with them. Maybe not. But the rest of us are getting reamed for having a job."

Even with this circus they are trying to pass off as health coverage I can‚Äôt see my doctor. Too expensive."
24,@WilFiacco @wink1radio What would businesses do with all the money they save when they no longer are required to buy private health insurance? I don‚Äôt know. Maybe pay their workers more?
25,"@WilFiacco @wink1radio They are desperately trying to keep your brain focused on the abstract and away from reality, to spin their narrative and win arguments.

49,@WilFiacco That was just an example. But yes I do believe we need green tech.
50,"@WilFiacco The federal government decides, democratically, that we need to transition to green tech, or go to Mars, or Ceres. Large corporations fulfill that contract.
Rather than large corporation donating millions to campaigns for their own agendas.
It‚Äôs wag the dog."
51,"@WilFiacco I think we need to make a very important distinction between businesses, especially small ones which should be autonomous, and huge industries the type that can affect earth-changing technologies. That might help the argument better."
52,@WilFiacco I would never advocate telling the private sector who they can and cannot hire.
53,"@WilFiacco I won‚Äôt pretend there are no holes in this argument, but I will say this:
If you want to work, you should have one a job. Fast, because bills don‚Äôt wait.
If not, be a slouch and don‚Äôt get paid.
It‚Äôs a free country.
Look up #FJG."
54,"@WilFiacco I am not an any way saying this will replace the private sector, not even slightly. They might be considered transitioning jobs for experience that lead to higher paying jobs in the private sector."
55,"@WilFiacco Do what unions do; council them then let them go if they‚Äôre a hopeless case. Trust me there are plenty in government jobs who do nothing now.
The biggest point here is this: the Federal government, more than any job creator, can absorb this issue."
56,"@WilFiacco Oh no that‚Äôs not it at all. It provides a job to everyone who wants to work. 
Red states actively punish people for working."
57,@WilFiacco Haha no I want all lousy workers to starve in the streets like dogs!
58,"@WilFiacco There are millions who want to work but are shut out by our musical chairs rotation.

59,"@WilFiacco Industry is rapidly heading toward green tech on its own so obviously some of those ‚Äúrich investors‚Äù have their heads on straight.
But it‚Äôs imperfect in a big way. Firstly, there are no guarantees of widespread economic benefits.

60,"@WilFiacco Also, most of the world is capitalist in some form or another.
We shouldn‚Äôt accept the negative sides of capitalism, like a joblessness percentage and only the wealthiest having a vote.
That‚Äôs why I support a #FederalJobsGuarantee and ending #CitizensUnited."
61,"@WilFiacco For capitalism to work and function in its pure‚Äîintended‚Äîform, a society must be aware of the dangers. It was never intended to consolidate power into the hands of the few but that‚Äôs what happened because we‚Äôre asleep at the wheel. It‚Äôs market manipulation."
