We called some buildings with 2021 expirations and only 1 picked up. Was an apartment complex where the property owner was receiving assistance via HUD Section 8. Luckily, HUD is still helping today."
60,We hope City Council Members can be proactive about reaching out to LAHD and working together with building owners and responsible agencies to ensure tenants are taken care. We've seen what an expiring affordable housing covenant can do with the @hillside_villa tenants.

Currently tenants/property owners are receiving some sort of financial assistance or subsidies from the government (local/state/federal). However, some of these apartments come with an expiration or are ""at-risk"" of losing their affordable housing."
