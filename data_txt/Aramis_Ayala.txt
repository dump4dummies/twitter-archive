1,"Yesterday while campaigning in Lee County my shy 8 yr old hugged me tight while my 10 yr old asked for the mic 😳 She told the crowd “You should vote for my mom. Let’s kick butt!”

5,"THANK YOU Justices Breyer, Sotomayor &amp; Kagan for an honorable attempt to ensure SCOTUS strikes balance as it often does- not in Dobbs.

9,"@LeannB2021 @SkartveitNancy Absolutely! It’s a crime, and the trauma endured by crime victims should not be compounded by laws that further enslave them."
10,… and to be clear: abortions will not end. This decision only impacts equal access to SAFE abortions.
11,"Today someone I love disclosed to me she was raped by an uncle at 9 years old. Her family found out she was pregnant at 17 weeks. 
Instead of becoming a 10 year mother she was able to exercise her right to a safe abortion. 
We must protect this right. This is not ok!"
12,As it relates to SCOTUS overturning Roe v. Wade and all the abhorrent attacks on women’s rights and freedoms I just released the following statement: https://t.co/l6VOfAPQcJ
13,"For those who justify or stand silent as other people’s rights are violated, don’t forget when it comes to greed &amp; corruption there’s no discrimination.

43,RT @FLRising: 💔 https://t.co/Tj7RkdbeTm
44,@TheWholeSecret It’s not radical to uphold it. It’s the way ones does it. Radicals are those who refuse to consider common sense application to avoid innocent slaughter. Those who support it objectively/ reasonably tend to be consistent in supporting all BOR
45,"If only 2nd Amendment radicals gave the same energy to ALL our Bill of Rights we’d have a stronger democracy. 💯
What about free speech &amp; religion, right to privacy, illegal searches, and protections from cruel &amp; unusual punishment? Selective enforcement destroys our democracy."

Don’t deflect. Deal with guns NOW!"
51,"Dear Conservative Christians… I too am a Christian, but one who believes we must live our lives with the heart of Christ, not the voice of judgment.
