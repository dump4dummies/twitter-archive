6,Our legal brief to SCOTUS outlined the many flaws of Roe v. Wade &amp; made clear that this issue should return back to the states.  Very proud of @RepublicanAGs &amp; Mississippi AG Fitch for their phenomenal work on this amazing achievement. We are going to save so many babies‚Äô lives!

13,@entropyfueled Please read up on the new SCOTUS case decision issued today!
14,"One of the biggest implications for West Virginia is that our citizens must now be provided with the opportunity to publicly carry a firearm in Maryland for self-defense.  

We will now be following up to ensure Maryland recognizes that right."
15,"The Second Amendment doesn‚Äôt ask individuals whether they have ‚Äúproper cause‚Äù to carry a firearm.  

Good for Justice Thomas and the U.S. Supreme Court for striking down this unconstitutional NY law!"
16,My Office will unpack this very important gun case (it‚Äôs 135 pages) and weigh in on how this will impact West Virginian and American families.  Look for more comments later today.  But this is a meaningful victory!!! #NewYorkStateRifle
17,"Pleased to be part of the State Coalition which helped secure a big win today at SCOTUS protecting our gun rights. 

States cannot impose unconstitutional burdens on the right to bear arms.  I‚Äôve been proud to lead many coalitions defending the 2A &amp; will continue to do so!"

We will be ready to discuss the case and implications of this critical matter.  After many years of litigating this issue, I am cautiously optimistic that we will prevail."
