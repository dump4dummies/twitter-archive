8,"This about power and controlling families. We need to make lives easier for families, not harder. #mt01 #mtnews https://t.co/zm4Kjigzul"
9,At a rally in Butte. Montanans‚Äô value women‚Äôs freedoms. Politicians and judges shouldn‚Äôt be deciding our own personal medical decisions. #mtpol https://t.co/nsj6yhWlrf
10,"Had the opportunity to address the @mtaflcio convention this afternoon. Working class Montanans deserve a leader in Congress who will stand by their side and have their interests in mind, not corporate special interests. #mtpol https://t.co/XmckIc24iz"
11,"We are not going to turn back the clock on modern life. We know what is at stake in this election.¬†

Congress must immediately act to protect the freedom of women and families and their private decisions, including when, and whether, to have a child."
12,"While my opponents Ryan Zinke and John Lamb have stood against American women‚Äôs freedom to live life on our terms, I‚Äôve spent my career standing up for working families and for all Montanans and their freedom, and I‚Äôll continue to do so in Congress. #mtpol #mt01 https://t.co/vZiWzG26Nm"
13,"I‚Äôm deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Eric Feaver, a veteran, union leader and advocate for workers, teachers, and education.

16,"My call for an investigation makes it at least 19 on Zinke, including lying under oath. Corrupt Zinke is in it for himself &amp; the special interests that have bought and paid his way. I‚Äôm running for Congress to fight for you. #MT01 https://t.co/xTyxQmTmi7"
17,Because our public officials need to be accountable to voters and the law - it‚Äôs what makes us a Representative Democracy.
18,"It has to be this JVL ‚ÄúEnterprises‚Äù ‚Äì a company that doesn‚Äôt even exist in Texas ‚Äì that paid him $410,000 for unknown services? We don‚Äôt know but every voter in #MT01 knows they can‚Äôt trust Zinke. Why? #MT01"
19,Or is it out-of-touch Zinke‚Äôs nearly half a million from #BigOil @ConocoPhillips while we pay record high prices at the pump? Or is it the payments from DC lobbying shops? Or the mining special interests that want another elected lobbyist in Congress? Wait‚Ä¶
20,Is it out-of-state Zinke‚Äôs multi-million dollar California home that his wife claims as her personal residence? Does he not want #MT01 voters to know that he spends most of his time in Santa Barbara? #MT01 https://t.co/uIai9QLVA5
21,"This isn‚Äôt the first time Zinke failed to follow the law over his financial disclosure. Corrupt Zinke is still trying to hide his personal enrichment schemes from #MT01 voters because he thinks the law doesn‚Äôt apply to him. But let‚Äôs take a üëÄ #mtpol 
https://t.co/rPqS33koQo"
22,"üßµ Again, corrupt scandal-plagued @RyanZinke blew his personal financial disclosure deadline. Why? Because he‚Äôs made over $1.3 million lobbying/consulting for the same corporate interests and #BigOil companies price-gouging us at the ‚õΩÔ∏è. #mt01 #mtnews

41,"Ryan Zinke had multiple chances to show up for Montanans, but instead of serving Montana, he served himself. Zinke‚Äôs record of corruption has contributed to a primary result that shows his own party does not trust him."
42,"Montanans are seeking a leader who will show up to every town and every county to listen to real life concerns and experiences, and who will work together for common sense solutions."
