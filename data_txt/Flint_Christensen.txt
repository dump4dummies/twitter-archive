1,@POTUS Sounds like we need to lower the age of buying a pistol. That looks like infringement to me.
2,@BurgessBoston @FoxNews You're absolutely right. That dumb b**** to the far right in this picture
3,"@maggiesgrandma @CNN What men identify as women, can we then?"
4,"@robreiner Pretty damn sure it was a Democrats that tried to force inject substance into people's body.

You are right elections matter."
5,"@mariashriver Maria Shriveled hag, are you sad that more babies can't be killed?"
6,@KrisNoel65 @DavidCornDC Your tears are delicious
7,@DavidCornDC Are you kidding me? We're doing fantastic. Didn't you hear that Roe vs Wade was overturned?! That's fantastic. Would not have been possible without Donald Trump!!!
8,@BernieSanders https://t.co/pjL5Km1qfw
9,@tedcruz @elonmusk @AOC Win
10,@AstralAlice_ @_follow_light_ @ninaturner @elonmusk You are wrong.
11,@AstralAlice_ @_follow_light_ @ninaturner @elonmusk You exploit labor every time you buy something. You should be ashamed
12,@ninaturner @elonmusk You realize he got rich by liberal wackadoodles trying to push clean energy electric cars üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
13,@AH_BazingaAce93 @djaouikam @VP No. You.
14,"@AH_BazingaAce93 @djaouikam @VP Died ""with"" covid not ""of"" covid"
15,@CNN I didn't realize CNN still existed. I will make a cash offer to buy your establishment for 43$ and half a case of Twinkies
16,@AH_BazingaAce93 @djaouikam @VP Nobody is shutting down businesses and forcing government to inject something into your body with the flu either. Have you considered that you might be a moron?
17,@dj_french12 @MimzyIvez @VP I'll bet you couldn't tell the survivability rate of somebody who's not vaccinated. Even if it's height the percentage of risk to even the elderly amongst us was ridiculously minimal.
18,"@VP I didn't realize covid was still a thing ü§∑ you should probably isolate yourself for the next few years. Don't talk to anybody. Like seriously, anybody."
19,@SenWarren Don't you shake your hair at me!!!üò°
20,@RaShon1984 @SenWarren How about Elon use his money and buy Twitter and whoever took his money to sell Twitter does what you suggestü§∑. A win for everybody.
21,@SenWarren Your tears are delicious
22,@POTUS You should promise him that if he gets rid of all his nukes that we will protect them...
23,@tedharmon6 @rains_wings @IdahoStatesman Neither.
24,"@rains_wings @IdahoStatesman With your logic, disorders simply don't exist. That is a difficult premise to agree with."
25,@IdahoStatesman Imagine giving yourself the authority to to say you are a woman. Without the ability to define what it means to be a woman.
26,"@IdahoStatesman It was popular in Japanese culture to bind the feet of women to make their feet smaller. In other cultures they would lash boards to the foreheads and mutilate the skull. Female genitalia mutilation is still practice today in some cultures. 

It all seems very barbaric to me."
27,@POTUS You're pretty good at stunting economies Mr President. Ask any American
28,@maddow It's also folly to try to mandate anything being injected under somebody's skin.
29,@DanRather And what's your take on the collusion hoax with Russia?
30,@KTVB I'll let my sister-in-law who's a nurse know...who isn't working for the hospital any longer
31,@bogiewrld @POTUS No
32,@iPrabhatMishraa @Fucktarditis @POTUS Chinese military... maybe. Say when
33,"@iPrabhatMishraa @POTUS I speak for everyone when I say, ""eat a dick"""
34,@POTUS You have a lot of nerve Brandon.
35,"@Renaissance567 @CNN There are definitely two justices going on, glad you finally can see that"
36,@CNN Good
37,@CNN Do you need ID to get a covid vaccine?
38,"@POTUS ‚ÄúI mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that‚Äôs a storybook, man.‚Äù"

43,@OptimusSnarf @POTUS No
44,@POTUS I'm not wearing a stupid mask or getting the Fauci ouchi. Kiss my ass Brandon.
45,@Mike0243 @CNN I'll bring the hotdogs
46,@CNN Why report the news when you can just make it up.
47,@CNN Weak
48,@CNN https://t.co/2KHUmMCOAS
49,@cjsob68 @CNN I'll make up a reason then if it's so illegal ü§∑üôÑ. Nobody is required to hire someone that they don't feel is a good fit for their company.
50,@cjsob68 @CNN Please site your sources.
51,"@CNN There's not a chance in hell I will ever hire someone who ""graduated"" from these liberal bastions of intellect (hell holes)."
52,@MachngunKerry @Dduval1973 @csparks17 @mattgaetz Well the Constitution is a document that restricts the government it doesn't Grant rights to citizens...
53,@csparks17 @mattgaetz I'll bet there was quite a few million Jews that wished a few Germans wouldn't have followed orders. I'll bet there was quite a few native American tribes that wished that soldiers didn't follow orders.

59,@paulocomments @kevinnfoster @CNN Good thing we're not a democracy. We're a constitutional republic. ü§∑
60,@GeorgeTakei Umm...you literal are attracted to another dude. Not sure you have a strong grasp on correct principles dude.
61,@GeorgeTakei The secrets you seek are found when you kneel in prayer.
62,@KeefePhilip @TheStonesEG @RIHEALTH No

66,@CNNHeroes @CNN Strange you don't have Kyle Rittenhouse on there
67,@clairecmc Tell me there's a swamp without telling me there's a swamp
68,@POTUS At this point I am pretty sure you couldn't even define the word inflation
69,@TimothyPSmith7 @CoachSDSU @VP your head is in the sand so I'm not sure how much noise you can actually hear
70,@EighteenVenture @ETBowden @VP As a small business owner I reserve the right to choose who I hire and fire
71,@maddow That awkward moment when Rachel realizes that she's not an actual journalist
72,"@peacelove_all @POTUS We're not a democracy, we're a constitutional republic."
73,@POTUS Hunter's laptop
74,@Cr7_undisputed @POTUS You don't speak for me
75,@POTUS We'll need someone to play the music while the country sinks to the bottom of the ocean

77,@POTUS Moron
78,@CNN In unrelated news civil war has broke out in Louisiana. Initial shot fired was believed to have come from Bob's Crab shack.

88,@deray I love your blackness and my whiteness. What's not to love?
89,@CNN @ChrisCillizza I'm thoroughly enjoying this comment thread with the wackadoodle liberals trying to play mental gymnastics over what everybody else knows: owning a gun is about self-defense from crazy mobs and defense of tyranny. Also effective with hunting
90,@TomDurante @nypost So apparently Brian Laundrie died of self-inflicted wound to the Head. But without the gun there really is nothing that Ties his murder to me and that's the important thing.
91,"@liz20473173 @Annakhait I'm not sure which is bigger, the gap between your ears or the gap between your teeth."
92,@TheThinker1958 @CNN No. That simple
93,@_bahhumbug @utind84124 @CNN How is abeling people to enjoy their freedom and insult?  I don't understand
94,@CNN You know how long it took me to realize that covid was more a political virus than a threatening one? Two weeks.
