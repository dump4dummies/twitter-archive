1,"I'm reminded of this Ben Sasse speech during the Kavanaugh hearings, which was praised by even some Dems as a level-headed lament about the politicization of the Court. Rather, it was a direct assault on the administrative state and our ability to govern. https://t.co/HE5JPmocDN"
2,"Awful implications for workers' rights, civil rights, regulation of corporate power, environmental protection, and more. An important part of the years-long right-wing jurisprudential project - one of those about which large corporations care most."
3,"SCOTUS is out to kill the administrative state, which allows for basic functioning of our government. It's where expertise lies, and the alternative - forcing narrow decisions to be made by new statute - isn't practicable even when we don't have total legislative paralysis. https://t.co/oVTVUrrIE5"
4,And here's a letter from 25 senators about actions the Biden Admin could potentially take. It's all triage until we get federal legislative and court reforms through - but there are things we can/must do at state level and through federal exec branch. https://t.co/Lv1G8wkeSY
5,"The solidarity demonstrated in light of yesterday's devastating news has been extraordinary. The compact among west coast states described here, and California's funding to help people in *other* states secure care, should be model for RI and neighbors. https://t.co/wptnYbbrRB"
