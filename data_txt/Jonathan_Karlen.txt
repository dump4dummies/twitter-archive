3,Great afternoon discussing housing policy with the Habitat for Humanity of Missoula team! I’m excited about the opportunity to advance policies in the Legislature that ensure working and retired Montanans can afford high-quality homes in our community. #mtpol #mtleg https://t.co/PVQAjSAL00

10,@McIntyre_Magic I’m glad we got to share the moment with you and Rita!
11,@ciaramax__ I’m excited to work with you and the team for the general!!
12,"I’m honored to be elected the Democratic nominee to represent HD96 in the MT legislature! A huge thanks to everyone who trusted me with their vote, shared their perspectives on important issues, and supported my campaign. Now its on to the the general election! #mtpol #mtnews https://t.co/Ur15uqGFT3"
13,@NickLOwens Totally agree! #mtleg
14,@MontanaPolitic1 Thanks for the info on all the races!
15,"@tyto96 @BillyMcWillia12 If we win back seats in the Legislature and Montanans (in both rural and urban areas) continue to push for common sense laws, I really do believe that we can start chipping away at the drivers of gun violence. #mtpol"
16,@Ktbird37 @shannonrwatts Thanks!
17,Below is my op-ed about how the MT legislature needs to adopt sensible gun laws to save the lives of Montanans. https://t.co/fCayysxROS. #mtpol #mtleg #GunSafetyNow #GunViolence
18,Some politicians seem to forget that one of the most important roles of government is to protect its citizens from enemies foreign and domestic. Gun violence is a domestic enemy. There are commonsense solutions if more politicians choose to be leaders. #mtpol #mtleg #mtnews
19,The tragedy in TX is yet another example of what happens when politicians fail to be leaders. When they choose campaign donations and political safety over the actual safety - and lives- of their constituents.#mtpol #mtleg #mtnews
20,"While much has changed since the Constitutional Convention in 1972, and our state and nation are deeply polarized, I still believe a that love of the land unites Montanans. #mtpol"
21,"Thank you Leadership MT and @MansfieldCenter for hosting an insightful discussion about the MT Constitution. A quote that stuck with me was Mae Nan Ellingson describing how ""Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, the thing that united us was a love of the land.""#mtpol https://t.co/dpbpoCAzd3"

25,Thanks @AmericanYouthf1 for the endorsement! I'm excited to fight for policies to make Montana a leader in renewable energy and climate change mitigation and adaptation. #mtpol https://t.co/xDYW7p9mKO
26,@ciaramax__ Thanks for all you do!!
27,"So sad to hear about Sen. Sweeney’s passing. I distinctly remember his kindness, passion, and humor. Between his decades of work with FWP, service in the Legislature, and campaign for Congress, he has made Montana a better place for all of us. #mtpol  https://t.co/p5w0HWVFQG"
28,RT @RoArquette: I am one of the 70 % Americans that support Roe v wade how about you?
29,"@Shan73198 @BillyMcWillia12 @Marum4MT @MTMaryAnn @bessette4mt @JKrotkov @jennamtphoto @Melissa4HD23 HD 96 in Missoula County is a seat that we can, and will, flip this cycle. The GOP incumbent won by less than 200 votes out of more than 7,000 and the seat has flipped parties every election for the past decade. I've knocked thousands of doors so far and know we can do it! #mtpol"

MT can and should be a leader in renewable energy production - it would create good paying jobs across MT, enhance our air and water quality, and save us money.#mtpol https://t.co/NnkFowApHu"
36,@BeaFrissell @SenatorTester @GovGianforte @TrumanApp Huge congrats on the Truman!! Such an awesome way to represent UM and MT!
37,"@HertzRep And Article II, Section 13 says: ""All elections shall be free and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage."""
38,"@HertzRep The courts will have to apply strict scrutiny and the state will get a chance to prove its compelling interest in potentially limiting a fundamental right. My point with op-ed is not about the legality of the laws passed, but my concern about politicizing the courts. #mtpol"
39,"Last week, MT Republican leaders chose to delegitimize our courts in their response to an injunction being placed on voter suppression bills they passed in 2021. Their rhetoric is leading us down a dangerous path. #mtpol #mtleg Read more in my op-ed: https://t.co/7u1ZPdb9WV"

44,The science fair also highlights  why we need to provide MT schools with the funding/resources they need to inspire students and prepare them to tackle real-world challenges. Investing in students now will make MT an innovation leader for decades to come. #mtpol #mtleg #science
45,It was a pleasure to serve as a judge for the Montana Science Fair today!

98,"@RcRegalstarfire As for grazing, I fully support the multiple-use mandate of our public land agencies and well-managed grazing where land and wildlife managers/scientists deem it appropriate. Recent research I've seen shows that well-managed grazing does not adversely impact biodiversity."
99,@RcRegalstarfire Thanks for the question! I support what the scientists say regarding hunting in a given park. There are so many factors when it comes to wildlife management that I don't think there can be one broad policy. Ex.hunting is a key tool to prevent Chronic Wasting Disease spread.
