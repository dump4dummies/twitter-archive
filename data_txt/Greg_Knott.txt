5,@kaitlin_lange IN is one of 20 states that allow teachers to carry but not one of the handful like NH that allows teachers the right to carry in school without being specifically authorized. Schools aren‚Äôt safe when sociopaths know defenseless victims are inside and Holcomb should have said so.
6,"@kaitlin_lange @CarloniBrittany When a lawyer has facts on their side they argue them, if they have the law they argue that, if they have neither they pound the table. Anti-2A pols have neither facts nor the law nor a supermajority to modify 2A, so they curse the law abiding citizens who support 2A. Pathetic."

11,@marybschneider Why would they cave when the proposed policies have nothing to do with school shootings and would not have prevented the Texas mass shooting? Who would they be virtue signaling?
12,@kaitlin_lange @ChrisSikich This isn't a defect in permit-less carry which law abiding Vermont citizens have had for their entire history of their ultra-liberal state. This is a systemic defect in IN's data system which doesn't let police know who is prohibited from gun possession. Fix *that*.
13,"@MarkLegac @kairyssdal @Marketplace Other nations do not have the 2A which protects us from gov't infringing on keeping &amp; bearing arms. Private gun ownership is way up in USA and violent crime way down, maybe mass shootings would be down too if schools weren't pretending to be 'gun-free'. https://t.co/Qz0CPuM6CB"
14,@kaitlin_lange He should've asked which policy proposal would've prevented this school shooting or any other. The inconvenient answer is none of them: https://t.co/xuLQWm5EEu
15,@KirkBoller @kaitlin_lange @GovHolcomb Permitless carry doesn't 'make it easier to get guns'. It simply makes gun possession by 'prohibited persons' (like felons) illegal while making it legal for any other person to carry without a permit. IN was already a 'shall issue' permit state. Buying requirements unchanged
16,"@suptdrmccormick Nope, they voted to override the veto on the regularly scheduled day for Corrections. Thank goodness since so few in our democracy think males competing in girls‚Äô sports is fair. If teachers get their 2A rights restored at school, evil psychos cannot become mass murderers."

18,@JeromeTaylor @kairyssdal Perhaps this explains why Australia's COVID lockdown was so draconian compared with the USA where keeping and bearing arms is a constitutional right rather than a gov't granted privilege. Tyranny is more difficult with private gun ownership. 2A protects other rights.

34,"@HicksCBER Nope, the test we have done is where charters share only state funds and zero local funding. Imagine how badly districts would bleed enrollment if they had to equitably share local funds based on a level playing field of enrollment‚Ä¶true backpack funding, not vouchers."
35,"@HicksCBER Nice dodge. Apparently, answering a simple question is too much to ask of you. You see the downside of monopolies with hospitals but not with district schools. Interesting ü§î"
36,"@HicksCBER Put another way- if per student funding equity wouldn‚Äôt result in more families exiting district monopolies and taking funds with them, why would equity be opposed so rabidly by districts and unions? Let‚Äôs test it. I bet we see an increase on top of the pandemic related increase."
37,"@HicksCBER If you were a parent of modest income, a school receiving equal taxpayer support per student providing transportation would be an equal choice to you as one that expected you to provide it? That would be absurd. Monopolies don‚Äôt work. Funding equity and free markets do work."
38,"@CroozMillah @indystar Moving the goalposts here. The ‚Äúnever‚Äù quote was a knock on my opponent calling himself a proven conservative when his post was the opposite. Nothing was said about me or what I would or wouldn‚Äôt say. I am a conservative, not a conservative pretender like Dave ‚ÄúHolcomb‚Äù Hall."
39,"@CroozMillah @indystar That is data cited directly from IDOE web site on school demographics. Conservative voters are not comfortable with this rapid transition. Others may have a different view, especially those who aren‚Äôt impacted directly. Ask a Seymour parent of any party what they think."
40,@HicksCBER Why would that result surprise anyone given the unequal taxpayer support? Example: charters get $0  from property taxes and referendums. Charter parents provide their own transportation. How many poor families can make that choice work pragmatically? Monopolies don‚Äôt work.
41,@HicksCBER Are we talking different programs? I propose to replace vouchers with ESA equal in value to per pupil funding (local property taxes and state taxes which are roughly half each) for districts. No red tape for schools to comply with like vouchers. Not the 529 plan for high earners.
42,"@HicksCBER Did I miss the enactment of ESAs with 100% of per student local property taxpayer and state taxpayer support? Vouchers are limited, not of equal value, and come with red tape for recipient schools. Other states are far ahead of IN on ESAs and choices for all, not just wealthy."
