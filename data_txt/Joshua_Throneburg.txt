52,4) Extending special protections for agricultural land historically farmed by Black and Indigenous people and expanding the Socially Disadvantaged Groups Grant program for farmers of color who disproportionately lost their land to consolidation and buyouts.
53,"3) Increasing access to low-interest, federally backed microloans and cost-share support to allow new farmers to buy land at prices they can afford, and to give farmers looking to transition into sustainable and regenerative farming practices access to supportive capital."
54,"2) Reworking our current farm policy so it is less burdensome on small farms; current regulations for giant agribusiness aren't cost-effective for small farms prevents them from exploring sustainable practices, organic certification and direct-to-consumer sales."
55,"1) Carving out estate tax protections for small farms, eliminating capital gains taxes for farm inheritances and creating a plan for structured staggered repayment of delinquent farm taxes.  Nobody should lose their family land because they are too tax-burdened to pass it on."
