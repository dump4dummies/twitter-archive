The only reason I can see the baby being taken after 20 weeks but before term is if it were going to kill mom, which at that point a cesarean could be performed."

That's a baby! 

It can live outside of the mother at that stage. 

If she had doubts about having a baby, then she should make that choice well before the baby is viable outside of the womb."
