1,@Scubadoobe @TheSocrateej @WarPath2pt0 Not in most states
2,@septicstepic @bigbillx69 @Doener @elonmusk The board doesn't own Twitter. Apparently the board owns less that 1% of the company.
3,"@JeremysRazors I shave about once a month. Done randomly throughout that day.  Though I still bought your  razor, because your commercial was awesome."
4,"RT @Team_SNEED: I made this as a joke, but let's take a vote - 1000 RTs and I add this shell of a man to the game for real. https://t.co/d3…"
5,"@RALee85 Attrition favored the attacker in ww2, but would probably favor the defender in Ukraine.  I'd say it's situation dependent"
6,@JVSylvester @KenPaxtonTX The state has always regulated child abuse.   Mutilating a child body before the age of consent is definitely child abuse.
7,"@JoshLWhitfield @ZelenskyyUa @DefenceU @Ukraine I haven't posted it on here, but I agree.  We can't let local dictators become world dictators."
8,@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Ok.  I'll give you abortions before 20 weeks are ok for woman who are raped.  But all others are bad and outlawed.  I've met you halfway.
9,"@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Agreed raping children is evil.  You are attempting to use this scenario to justify murdering babies, so tell us how prevalent the problem is."
10,"@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Please share the statistics of how many 12 year old girls are being raped by a family member, getting pregnant and getting an abortion."
11,@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo This literally makes 0 sense.  Wanna try again.
12,"@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Abstain, use birth control, choose adoption, be a mother.  There are plenty mindful ways to deal with making babies.  Just stop murdering the innocent."
13,@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Agreed.  Mind your body.  Don't murder babies.
14,@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo Murdering babies no matter their age is the greatest evil in our society.  The fact that you support this shows just how brain washed you are.  You really need to read up on the Parental Rights in Education bill.  You are not being honest
15,"@JoCaPaLe @Menelopieflower @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo I'd love to see the laws that are bigoted,  racist or sexist."
16,"@JoCaPaLe @Menelopieflower @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo I know right.  Pro business, pro gun, pro constitution.  What an amazing state."
17,@Menelopieflower @JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo I know I am trying to figure out a way to move to FL.
18,"@Menelopieflower @JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo California has health care for its citizens?  Universal health care was shot down, because it was too expensive.  Even in this far left lib state"
19,"@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo So you are mad teachers can't espouse leftist ideologies to elementary school kids, and he doesn't want mothers killing babies?"
20,@JoCaPaLe @JPrufrockAlfred @HeathMayo I'd love to know what personal freedom they are taking away.
21,"Everyone worrying about WWIII needs to calm down.  Putin has no serious allies, and as such he is not a serious military threat.  If he can't defeat Ukraine, he can't even get started with NATO.  

Now if you are worried about him pushing the button, that's a more likely scenario"
22,"@jsrailton @elonmusk Man pack radios.  This is virtually impossible against directional antennas.  Especially antennas broadcasting directly to space.  Based on a cursor review of phased array tech, it appears these are electronically directed signals, so very little chance of triangulation."
23,"@jsrailton @elonmusk You seem to not understand how signal triangulation works.  You need normally 3 stations receiving signals, Preferably 120 degrees apart.  Three stations will provide accurate targeting data.  This is easily done against omni directional antennas (cell phones, sat phones,"
24,@devlwvlf @EndGameWW3 Drafts are just laws passes by congress.   So only the political will to do it.
25,"@Osinttechnical Without a single blast crater, I doubt it was artillery.  Could have been direct fire at"
26,RT @OSINT_Eye_: Footage of a column of #Russian trucks and mobile bridges was destroyed overnight in the #Kherson region. https://t.co/qN4f…
27,"@legalbytesmedia Can you discuss the law in Wisconsin?  ""This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593."" Is a pistol OK?"
28,"@EmilyAustinFire @MacFarlaneNews @RonBrownstein If this has you so full of rage that you can't sleep, then you are doing your life wrong.   
A mentor once told me to only worry about the things that I can control.  It's great advise.  Dont let politicians from different states control your actions."
