May we honor John Lewis by always being mindful of his words, and always standing up when there is injustice. 

Rest in Power, Congressman."
21,"As a member of Congress, he was that bodyâ€™s conscience, always looking out for minorities, the poor, and those whose voices are not typically heard in the halls of Congress."
22,"Our nation has lost a bright and shining light with the passing of Congressman John Lewis.

John Lewis was on the front lines of the civil rights battles that led to the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Public Accommodations Act, and more. He was a true civil rights leader."
23,"At last count, 37,000 votes remained uncounted. Some people stood in lines to vote for Senator West today. Out of respect for those who cast their votes in this historic election, Senator West will issue a statement in the morning, hoping more votes are tabulated by then."

52,Is there some magical place in the United States where you have more than one Congressman and more than two Senators representing you at the federal level? Because MJ Hegar must not be clear on how the federal government works if she thinks she has 6 and not 3 federal reps.
53,"My opponent says she wrote ""six ten dollar checks"" to the six people representing her in Congress. 

If you live in the U.S., you have a Congressman and two senators. That's three federal representatives. https://t.co/Vmjx1F8RAq"
54,"So, MJ, who again did you vote for in the 2016 Republican primary? She changing her story once again because she's been caught with facts that don't match. Carly Fiorina dropped out of the race 2/10/2016 &amp; early voting began 2/16/16. A new &amp; unique path of denial for Hegar."

72,"@KimsMom3 I am the first legislator in Texas history to introduce an assault weapons ban. My record on gun violence is strong. This was a protection measure rural schools sought. It is sad that groups like Brady Campaign, that Iâ€™ve stood with on 98%+ of my votes didnâ€™t examine my record."
73,@KimsMom3 Many school leaders asked for this. I am a firm believer that the government closest to the people is best for the people. This bill allowed local schools to make this decision with various restrictions.
74,"@KimsMom3 Hi, Ronda. The vote was on the school marshal bill. The bill allowed local districts to decide if they wanted to allow certain staff to be school marshals. There are so many rural schools in Texas that are 20+ minute distance from law enforcement if no SROs..."

76,"This is not due to biology, but rather to existing racial and economic inequality. Trump didn't do anything to address these issues before COVID-19. Now he's only making things worse."
77,"We also have a growing body of research showing that COVID-19 is having a bigger impact on minority communities - Native Americans, African Americans, and Latinos."
78,"We cannot continue with the ""barrel ahead at all costs"" mentality.

The lives of Americans are at risk. By now we all know someone who has suffered through COVID-19, and many of us have friends or relatives who have died of the disease."
79,"...and despite an unclear picture of how safe things will be when schools go back into session in a few weeks. Our rush to reopen southern states including Texas has already proven disastrous, with as many as 10,000 new cases a day in our state."

84,"@ghostinxbieber @travisconsidine @mjhegar No, I did NOT. I voted for school marshals. Iâ€™ve been to rural Tx and seen how far some of these schools are from law enforcement. Local leaders felt this could help rural schools in the event of gun violence. I favor local control, and local schools get to decide."
85,"@Audnumber @CJHnygfan Democrats deserve to know. The press isnâ€™t telling them these things. Limited resources and furloughs, I suppose, have prevented the press corps from vetting my opponent. Democrats deserve to know these facts."

88,@realFireblazes Nope. Saying the Gadsden flag had been fully co-opted as a symbol of hate a full year before my opponent metaphorically wrapped herself in it by making it her profile pictureâ€”and making the point an observant person would have known this.
89,You cannot explain away making this your profile pictureâ€”your PUBLIC FACEâ€”on social media in 2015 and saying you only thought of the military connotation when you saw the flag on TV daily used as a symbol for hate. A day to respond and thatâ€™s your spin? https://t.co/aJJM5zNeuM
90,Wikipedia notes more on the same Flag that one year later MJ Hegar made her profile picture. https://t.co/fW15ci813J
91,"It was used by the supporters of Cliven Bundy in 2014, in terrible ways. https://t.co/WzZAJXyEhR"
92,"Not to belabor the point, but it is a point that needs to be made: There is nothing MJ Hegar can say to downplay this. By 2015 when she made it her profile picture (tell the truth, now, it wasnâ€™t just a post), the Gadsden flag had been fully associated w/ far right extremism."
93,@DrMDunk @PatrickSvitek @JohnCornyn @mjhegar Cornyn knows he can beat Hegar. Polls show he can. I poll much closer to him than Hegar does.
94,"Also, is my opponent blind to the flagâ€™s more recent connotations? https://t.co/txaCQXC3qI"
95,"Come on, letâ€™s get real. Since 2011, that flag has symbolized the birtherism of the Tea Party, the racism of white supremicists, and more. She had it up on Facebook well after those connotations were widely known. Next excuse, please. This one doesnâ€™t work. https://t.co/L1JjfPuRg0"
96,She's not vetted by the press. She's not available to voters. Shouldn't our Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate care a little more about talking to everyday Texans? I guess I see it that way. Vote WEST! Locations: https://t.co/RyZVHwCfDJ
97,THE SAME QUESTION - AGAIN TODAY - WHERE'S MJ? We have lost count of how many times my opponent has failed to show up in front of voters. It happened again today when we sat down to talk about Latino issues. https://t.co/28swFTHwPy
