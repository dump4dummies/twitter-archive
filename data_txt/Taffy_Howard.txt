#ranchwisdom https://t.co/opQZ9EVU2t"
1,"Don‚Äôt be afraid of pressure, lean into it‚Ä¶remember, without pressure there‚Äôd be no diamonds.  Life is hard, we have the pressures of work deadlines, raising kids, peer pressure, and the political pressure to go along to get along‚Ä¶but stand strong and firm‚Ä¶become a diamond!"
2,"It took longer than 38 years (49), but today we celebrate the end of our nation‚Äôs wandering in the wilderness."
3,"You can‚Äôt keep giving everyone government handouts and not expect them to then want more and more‚Ä¶we are conditioning people to expect and want exactly that, bigger government, which means, less freedom."
4,"Being a fiscal conservative isn‚Äôt just not spending more than you HAVE, it‚Äôs not spending more than you SHOULD.  It means spending based on limited-government PRINCIPLES vs what RINOs and liberals believe, which is simply, do we have the money (or can we get it) and is it ‚Äúgood.‚Äù"
5,"@dawson_maska I love small businesses, but I DO have an issue with Elevate RC/Chamber‚Ä¶they care more about pushing ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù and getting more gov‚Äôt handouts for BIG businesses than helping small businesses.  I‚Äôm proud to be with all the other conservatives at the bottom of their scorecard!"
6,"@dawson_maska Maybe do your research before you tweet nonsense? My opponent compared bills I had signed into law just the last 3 years with all his bills he‚Äôs passed out of committee, the chamber, etc. Never an apples to apples comparison, but what do you expect from a RINO career politician?"
7,"The campaign would not have lasted a day without this guy and I can‚Äôt thank him enough for all he did‚Ä¶we celebrated our 33rd anniversary at a meet and greet and he never complained:-).

8,SD has been swimming in revenue every year I‚Äôve been there on Appropriations‚Ä¶but we have too many RINOs who claim to be conservative keep getting elected.  SD could pretty much reduce every tax/fee we have and still be fine.  Do we truly believe in limited gov‚Äôt anymore?! https://t.co/KI9HjmCgiu
9,"Banning guns will never change the hearts of evil men.  Only Christ can do that‚Ä¶so maybe instead of talking about doing something that‚Äôs clearly unconstitutional and won‚Äôt help anyways, we talk about the bigger issue‚Ä¶the fact we need to bring God back into our lives‚Ä¶"
