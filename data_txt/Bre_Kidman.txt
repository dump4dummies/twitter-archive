Go look at the spending from those races. Look at what happened in the primaries. Look at the messaging. Look at the donors. Look at who made money. Look at the outcomes."
1,"When it’s all stick and no carrot, the base loses incentive to show up. BUT this is only a problem if the Dems actually care about winning. 

The 2020 cycle made it clear that winning is less important than getting paid. Browbeat the base, motivate the donors. Get paid, repeat."
2,"Further: Democrats leverage the base’s legitimate fears around “cultural” issues in order to force complacency with their servitude of corporate interests.

For example: Forget student loan forgiveness, Roe is on the ballot! Forget universal healthcare or we’ll lose gay marriage! https://t.co/76YY616t8j"
3,"@Seanrcooper @tampa_tweeter @santiagomayer_ Good for you, but not everyone is motivated to go to bat for a fire hydrant. The Dems have to provide something more substantial than “not Susan Collins” in order to win in a state where independent voters outnumber both democrats and republicans. Maine chose the devil they knew."
4,"Notice the patterns. Don’t reward bad behavior. Send money to abortion funds instead.

Volunteer if you still believe the political industrial complex is worth helping along, but don’t let them get richer on our suffering. https://t.co/v9b7F1Z5tB"

6,@realMGHein @IvLumpkins @HeemanFragbard @geomathMEW A lot of people have shown they’re capable of looking past disabled people in the last few years. Including all three choices for Governor. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
7,"@realMGHein @IvLumpkins @HeemanFragbard @geomathMEW Truthfully, I think being anti-mask counts as evil at this point in time. My last stay in the hospital really cleared that up for me.

If someone could talk some sense into him on that front, I’d be all in. For now, I’m really not feeling like lifting a finger for any of them."
8,"@realMGHein @IvLumpkins @HeemanFragbard @geomathMEW Hunkler strikes me as the most principled of the options, but I can’t in good conscience vote for a medical doctor who doesn’t support mandatory masking in 2022. 

Not that Mills or LePage will do better. I really don’t trust any of them to protect my interests. Shit sandwich."
9,"@stvienicks4prez I believe the best way to keep money out of politics is not to put it there in the first place, so I don’t throw cash into races anymore. That said, if someone has a phone bank list or a text list, I’m happy to donate time."
10,"Ope, I was wrong. https://t.co/88aA7MqAcC"
11,"Cop dropped out of the race, but I will bet you anything he doesn’t get charged. RI has a nasty habit of hiding cops who break the law in other departments. https://t.co/M14rvzhZtx"
12,@ongreenthings We don’t have elected judges for criminal cases. I think probate judges might be elected but… not quite the same impact.
13,"@TiffanyBond @jaramil4 @tampa_tweeter @santiagomayer_ This. And: the people who paid for the polls has a vested interest in the results turning out a certain way. To that end, most of the polls didn’t even mention all of the candidates in the race. The data was bad."
14,"RT @cyndeecexxx: remember stonewall, where gay people voted a lot"
15,"@tampa_tweeter @santiagomayer_ The establishment democrats idiotically steamrolled the primary, completely overriding the chance for Mainers to choose a candidate they genuinely preferred to Collins. They ran a sock puppet and cashed in on the grift."
16,"@Steve80695844 Respectfully: shut the fuck up, Steve."
17,"Kinda glad my healthcare team is telling me to give this other med that makes me sleep ~16 hours a day a week to see if it works because, between the physical pain and the politics, being present in the world right now is fucking unbearable.

Don’t tell my bank account, though.🥴"

31,@OXDAGAWD @smoke_nd_pearlz I’m not upset. I’m tired of people derailing conversations about practices which deny healthcare by touting higher risks while also blaming fat people for the medical profession’s refusal to act as though fat people face ANY health risks that can’t be solved by not being fat.

34,"@OXDAGAWD @smoke_nd_pearlz What the fuck does that have to do with the way doctors refuse to take fat people’s medical concerns seriously?

If you think we are at higher risk, either we deserve to be taken seriously by doctors or you are advocating for eugenics. Period."
35,"@OXDAGAWD @smoke_nd_pearlz So… doesn’t that mean her concerns should have been taken MORE seriously since she would have been, by your logic, at HIGHER risk of something being seriously wrong?

If not, please just say you want fat people to die and leave."

46,"Endoscopy report came back &amp; ruled out both “faking” &amp; “too much weed” as my issue. Might’ve been cool if they read that before I was discharged but, due to the *~not a big deal anymore ~* pandemic, Maine Med only has space for people who are actively incompatible with life rn."
47,@ninaturner You know it’s the second one. Look no further than Sara Gideon.
48,"@Sethrogen @sithix Okay but if you’re really down to pay $20 a minute for a cam show, you should really pop into these DMs. 👀"
49,@blackgirlinmain I’m a little peeved that she’s doing $2500 a head shows for Adam Schiff when he’s got a would-be first ever trans congressperson on the ballot against him.

53,"@ilanaslightly Gonna give it a try!

Thank you so much for sharing 💗"
54,"@ilanaslightly From my earlier bouts, I know this to be mostly true. AND ALSO: I hate that normalizing increasingly high levels of pain is A Thing and I’m sorry you’ve had to do it 💗"
55,@literElly Have you noticed any patterns to the days that don’t feel totally unbearable? I guess I’m trying to find coping skills so that I can get a couple of those under my belt.
56,"I spent a decade at 4/10. It wasn’t great. I had JUST found a way out when this hit and I’m fucking devastated. Resentful. Angry. Sad. Scared.

I know there has to be a way. I know people live like this. I know there isn’t another option. I have to figure it out. So. Skill share?"
57,"I’m publicly vulnerable. I can’t do *~polished &amp; collected~*. It’s good &amp; bad, but it’s what I’ve got. This is still hard.

So. I’m accepting that I need to learn to live in severe pain. Not 4/10, but 7-9 out of 10. Daily.

So, earnestly, I’m asking: how do people live like this?"

62,I am once again asking democrats to stop looking to Hillary fucking Clinton as a source on how to win elections.
63,@unfoundbassist My doctor changed her tune when I told her she’d also need to document that I haven’t puked once and that hot showers and capsaicin don’t help if she wanted to list that as my diagnosis. Still gonna stop to make sure the next guy doesn’t try and hit me with that again.

69,"@murphelaw @PridePortland I had an EKG and exams in the hallway. I was lucky enough to get an ER room after like 10 hrs and a room on a partial COVID unit about 8 hrs later. But. 18hrs to get a room, and I’m wearing a mask 24/7 while very sick and I can’t have anyone visit, even to bring a fresh mask."
70,"I can’t BELIEVE what I’m hearing about no masks at @PridePortland. From the fifth floor at Maine Med, where I can’t have visitors because the only bed available for a high risk patient was in a partial COVID unit, I’m telling you: it’s a really fucking bad time to get sick."
