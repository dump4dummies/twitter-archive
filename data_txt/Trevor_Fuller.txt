https://t.co/DwBzvBscQE"

30,My heart aches for the senseless loss of life yesterday because of the  shooting at UNC Charlotte. This violence has got to stop. We can no  longer just offer thoughts and prayers when these shootings occur. We  have a moral duty to take action...now.

32,"Today, SCOTUS is hearing a case on the constitutionality of a proposed 2020 census question about citizenship.  Trump allies want this question but opponents say it will cause fewer people to answer the census.  Who do you believe?"

35,"It's #EqualPayDay &amp; women do not earn equal value. On average, a woman makes just 80 cents to a man's dollar - even less for African American &amp; Latina women.

Women have been fighting for equal rights for over 200 yrs. Let's get serious about their equality &amp; close the wage gap."

38,"Remember those bold pronouncements from U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis about standing up to an abuse of power by President Trump?
Never mind. He takes them back. Misspoke. Didn’t mean them.
Upon further review, fuggedaboutit. https://t.co/VFVSYBpkgI"
39,"Heartbroken by the loss of life in New Zealand. My prayers are with people of faith around the world. Houses of worship should be safe places for fellowship. We must reject hatred and Islamophobia. I'm committed to the safety of our Muslim brothers and sisters here at home."""
40,"Under pressure from Trump and the far right-wing of his party, Thom Tillis has failed the people of North Carolina.  Two weeks ago, he pretended to be an independent voice that we need in the US Senate but today he showed his true colors.  He must be defeated in 2020 #ncpol"
41,"Inspired by all the women who have felt empowered enough to tell their truth in these trying times. Women who have felt strong enough to tell their stories to the world about unspeakable repression.
I am here today because of such women. #InternationalWomensDay"

58,I laud congressional Democrats for standing up to Donald Trump and his  pipe dream of a border wall. A wall is a medieval approach to a modern  concern. The government must remain open beyond Feb. 15 in accordance  with the wishes of the American people. Let's move on.
