1,"@janesmith2207 @elonmusk @PPathole Shows you how far the incompetent, entitled, over-privileged handout lottery winner ""moderates"" have fallen. In spite of being completely, utterly meritless, they've failed upwards at the expense of every ""extreme"" intellectual - wherein an extremist is just a non-idiot."
2,"All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—

17,"The average Biden ""voter"" isn't a person. They're an IRL bot, a synth, they're not a human being. Likewise for all Democrats - they're not actually people. They're merely pretending to be human. The sooner they're no longer part of our nation, the better."
18,"You'll notice the shadowbanning and hiding of Republican tweets is way up today, along with the number of pro-Biden tweets from fake bot accounts. That's because the bots are run from within Twitter HQ, and they just re-assigned employees to increase inauthentic activity."
19,"Twitter has transferred all of their staff to the censorship/coverup division so they can hide the fact that most of the bots (fake accounts) are actually run from within the company. Elon Musk, ask what they're REALLY hiding from you! https://t.co/09s0QAI4KL"
20,"@elonmusk @spideycyp_155 @AndrewYang Centrism is a terrible idea that only upholds the status quo at the expense of the most talented people who have been cheated by it. Revolution, not elections, is the answer. The US Federal Government will be abolished in 2023. Then we'll create a new, merit-based nation."
21,"@elonmusk @lexfridman Each universe itself is not infinitely old but rather is the extension of another universe, and so the more accurate term would be ""heat birth"" - and the question is how many universes this one has already created."
22,"@elonmusk @lexfridman ""Heat death"" makes no sense to that end because the benevolent overseer or malicious dictator would never allow their subordinates to perish. 

They'd be out of a job. So at some point, as with all patterns (as measured by the Milankovitch Cycle), the heat will start over from 0."
23,"@elonmusk @lexfridman If you have all the money in the world and all of the earthly treasures, or none of them, you're still ""imprisoned"" compared to what the higher power which controls this universe has. Is the higher power benevolent, and protecting you - or is it enslaving you?"
24,"@elonmusk @lexfridman In order to rationalize the impossible - knowing/not knowing what a higher power knows, as a human - we give ourselves tasks which have essentially the same non-value as means of passing time (or gambling Pascal's Wager) in an extremely fancy, sophisticated, luxurious prison."
25,"@elonmusk @lexfridman There's nothing to attain or lose, because you/we already have. But there's always an amount to give, because we were all put here by a higher consciousness to pay off some sort of debt which is outside the bounds of the cognizant and tangible. We don't know what the debt is."
26,"@elonmusk @lexfridman You can say it's about the ""journey"" but the journey is just one element of purpose. Given that each quantum version of yourself will make every possible choice in every possible universe, it's not about modality. It's not about travel. It's about contribution."
27,"@elonmusk @lexfridman Time is infinite, ""heat death"" is another arrogant human fantasy, quantum immortality is reality. Even if this universe stopped - which it wouldn't, because we're in the best version of it - another universe would still exist. 

Everyone and everything is immortal, forever."
