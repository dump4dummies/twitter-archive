1,@JackJoh42242513 I agree with you. I’m optimistic that we are not late to do what is right for our State and our Nation. Republicans are truly harming our nation and our communities; they’re disconnected from reality.
2,Really @TedCruz? We Deserve Better! #TedCruzResign https://t.co/RX7D0uyt6Z
3,"It is time to create a new immigration reform with a clear path to citizenship! With common-sense solutions, recognizing that many people, for years, have come to this nation looking for new beginnings and opportunities with the willingness to work hard for them. #DACA"
4,"@JackJoh42242513 Hello, there are some excellent impactful options and opportunities on the table I am evaluating. Our state and our country need us right now more than ever; I will continue the fight and join the campaign trails this summer to
GOTV, Texas deserves better."

6,"This is why #Republicans are not in sync with the American people. How selfish politicians can be, in order to hold on to power and receive donations. #WeDeserveBetter https://t.co/kUXu0HXjOx"
7,".@LeaderMcConnell, you know that this is not about lawyers and doctors; this is about low-middle class students with thousands of dollars in debt who after graduating will be competing for low/avg. income salaries. Republicans want a poor and illiterate country? 😕 https://t.co/u2z1pPDhgD"

12,"Here’s your fellow GOP Senator, what about you @TedCruz and @JohnCornyn? Are you two ready to put the life of the American people first? Or do you prefer to put y’alls personal agendas and @NRA’s interest first? https://t.co/eZmFbcxv2a"
13,".@TedCruz this is a perfect example of how you are focused on disinforming our communities and creating division. We, the Dems, are concentrated on removing criminals and mentally ill individuals from having access to buy a firearm; your inaction is causing death and tension. https://t.co/IIXrMQLV7N"
14,We deserve a country that recognizes that #LGTBQIA rights are human rights and understands that love is love! Ideneth and I are allies and will always stand up for #LGTBQIA equality; let’s celebrate #PrideMonth. https://t.co/fZ7bhZbrf9
15,".@DanCrenshawTX you should focus on #GunSafetyLaws, or if you want to talk about border/immigration, it’s time for a comprehensive immigration reform with a real path for citizenship. Not a misinformation forum. https://t.co/RNZQB5hi2F"
16,Let us remember and honor those who served and gave their lives for our country to ensure our freedom. https://t.co/IsuXaBfPwJ

18,".@voteTimScott what inflation are you talking about? Inflation is caused by the inaction of Republican Senators. The student loan cancellation will stimulate the economy, boost the #GDP and help workers who are #Women, #Blacks, #Latinx, #Immigrants + middle class Whites. https://t.co/h29E1lTFPv"
19,".@tedcruz I don’t want my kids to be next or any other children in this country. Be a man, and support legislation to establish #GunSafetyLawsNOW; you know it is the right thing to do. You think the @NRA can give you the presidency or a VP opportunity? It’s not happening… https://t.co/1S2DAM19E5"

23,#GunSafetyLawsNOW https://t.co/JUHtUFLpnm
24,.@TedCruz the way to stop criminal and mentally ill individuals from obtaining a firearm is by doing a background check to all. Rs focus on regulating women’s choices meanwhile our children are being killed at school because you make it political versus making it about the people https://t.co/7O7q8LJUQi
25,".@GregAbbott_TX, @LeaderMcConnell, @GOPLeader, @TedCruz the blood is in your hands! This continues to happen because of your inaction.
We need #GunSafetyNow; #BackgroundChecks (criminal/mental), #AssaultWeaponsBan, #RedFlagLaws, #WaitingPeriods, and raise the age to buy guns now. https://t.co/VLoCppU9Vk"
26,"Even though my role as a candidate has ended. My passion, sense of urgency, and commitment to serve you will not stop. I will continue this fight for what is right, for our underrepresented communities, for our children's future, and for all of those in need around us.

27,"It is time to move forward, unite our communities, and put all our effort, enthusiasm, and commitment into turning Texas blue in November."
28,It has been an amazing journey and incredible experience to meet thousands of people across this great state of Texas. I want to congratulate those that earned the nomination.
29,Thank you very much to the more than 337 thousand Texans that gave me their vote in the March primary and the more than 182 thousand that reaffirmed their support. ¡Mil Gracias! I am grateful for not only your vote but also your trust. https://t.co/wMVkHVdz4Y
30,It’s time to end Rs control in TX! Unfortunately we are living in a state controlled by individuals with a lack of common sense and leadership. It’s time for gun safety laws (State &amp; Fed). It is scary to think that the last time I might see my kid is before sending them to school https://t.co/10B5N7Vpec
