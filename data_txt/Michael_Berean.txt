6,"@lovennft Back in my day crypto wasn‚Äôt so heavily impacted by the traditional markets. But now that‚Äôs all over. It‚Äôs also, from an investment standpoint, a purely speculative asset for most institutional portfolios"

30,"@Snake_Em20 @GrowingDividend @RJN63021 @investor_valley @kpdawes It depends on the manager help select the securities, and risk profiles"
31,"@GrowingDividend @Snake_Em20 @RJN63021 @investor_valley @kpdawes That's a solid play brother, and it worked well. But 401k is limited to mutual funds and ETF typically, which can bring nice returns, but having the flex to put your capital into private equity (which can generate 400% ROI), CRE, specific securities etc. can be more lucrative"
32,@OneBandwagonFan @MyDailyPosts @Q_i_a_n_a Exactly
33,"@Q_i_a_n_a @jessgartner He probably read a headline about turning house titles into NFTs, which is a real possibility. NFT technology is what is important, not the Ape artwork, meaning the ability to create digital ownership certificates."
34,"@Q_i_a_n_a In the future, possibly, house titles will be an NFT. A digital, trackable form of ownership built on Blockchain."
35,@justingordon212 The metaverse
36,"@investor_valley @kpdawes That‚Äôs how they market it to you (the every day person), but there‚Äôs other ways to do that without dealing with fees / penalties if you want to use that cash before 59.5"
37,@RikHavic @Jim_Jordan Did you do it as a hardship withdrawal or loan?
38,@SteveHofstetter @Jim_Jordan If folks realized these retirement plans are pooled and sold off to the investment banks as giant capital accounts and they are just essentially micro cogs in a macro loan for 40 years they would take another approach
39,"@angelsforlove @kpdawes There‚Äôs a lot more to the markets than this, especially when they are connected globally - which they are"
40,"@kpdawes $401k is you lending out your money for 40 years. I can see the benefit of the employer matching aspect but outside of that, you could just diversify with a S&amp;P mutual fund, some treasury bonds and decent REITs and actually be able to spend it or reinvest the cash while young"
41,"@brantcooper The problem is, the purity leaves and is replaced by the drive of fame, money, power etc. Have you ever seen Icarus? A sporting event literally swayed an entire nation."
42,"#UFC274 Coming our to Last of the Mohicans is awesome, but #RobbieLawler did it first."
43,"It‚Äôs 2053, @elonmusk buys @tacobell after the franchise wars and we‚Äôre all stuck in the #metaverse watching Real Housewives of Mars."
44,@duncantrussell @BrendanSchaub @joerogan can you guys please produce a sketch comedy show based off of ‚Äúthe best of Craigslist‚Äù section of the site? I have never seen such insanity in my entire life. I‚Äôll help raise capital for it. #comedy #standupcomedy
45,"@sempervigilius @DTA7_PE @mauraball_ Nothing is worth your health, sleep, and sanity. No cause or ""grind"". Coming from an ex-burnout entrepreneur, I can safely say, you can accomplish even more by taking a step back, enjoying your days, relaxing, and taking care of yourself."

51,Some insight into the #Netflix #stock fiasco. #investing #cryptocurrency #Crypto #wallstreet #business #investors https://t.co/MKGFkUKreJ
52,"@Moofan01 @OhioEricJones Yes and an emphasis on : Credit, retirement plans, insurance, etc useful info"
53,"@emmanuelokoli_c @TokunboAdesina Should be, yes, it depends on the asset."
54,"Understanding what a company is actually worth (book ) vs. market price is very important, especially with the amount of intangibles so much value has been created on https://t.co/ALounIy3qM"
55,"@emmanuelokoli_c @TokunboAdesina The bank is just brokering the deal to your investments, so you should be on record still as owning those investments"
56,"@worldveganlaw @fredtheinvestor You follow communities and categories vs people/profiles, which is what I like try joining /investing /wallstreetbets /investors /financialplanning etc."
57,@fredtheinvestor Reddit is an incredible tool for information and knowledge
58,"@fredtheinvestor It's very easy to narrow in on insights you need (via directory categories / communities) I found the information more authentic and easier to find, and the platform is interactive ( I ask a questions and the community will answer)"
59,@Moofan01 @OhioEricJones Half the things I learned in school I never use and all the things I built my business on they don't teach in K-12.
60,@paruatsabi @sydneyelainexo @spmaloney @WorkingFamilies Flop? I decided to focus my time on my raising my daughter. ü§£
61,@ParikPatelCFA It's almost a scam at this point. lol
62,@fredtheinvestor Reddit has much better investment insight and knowledge.
63,"@WatcherGuru Bitcoin is a speculative investment. Very volatile. Not really tied to major financial markets (pensions, insurance, retirement, endowments), and what is the intrinsic value? Stocks and bonds in companies at least have the fundamentals and finances to review and analyze."
64,"@THEGYMRAT13 agreed. 

Succession
True Detective
Mr Robot
ZeroZeroZero 

by far best shows I've seen in awhile."
65,"@Cragwich1 Exactly, it was just filled with plot holes. And I was loving every second of season 4 until the last 20 minutes."
66,"@ajmilam73 Not so much that it wasn't a ""happy ending"" but it just seemed to have too many plot holes and I was 100% loving every episode up to the final one. Jonah was so against his family the whole time and even mentioned being out and then does that? The car scene had no purpose."
67,"@OhioEricJones This proposes the notion - ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way it is‚Äù - not true. Warren most likely uses complex tax strategies and vehicles to make that rate what it is, vs his secretary who does not. Knowledge is power. It‚Äôs not broken. It‚Äôs just you have to be willing to educate yourself"
68,"@Investingcom He‚Äôs right, at least on the retail level. All these brokerages do is bring order flow to the wirehouses"
69,"@ParikPatelCFA Crypto, is it an asset or a currency? Because it acts like an asset. What intrinsic value do these coins bring? Stocks and bonds of corporation, I can read the financials and fundamentals but what do these coins bring?"
70,@AltcoinGordon It‚Äôs subjective. That could be 20-30 years of expenditures for some people.
71,@Stonekettle The market can work against the every day middle and upper middle. You are essentially loaning out your money to investment banks and uhnw investors at a low interest rate. But when our kids want a credit card it‚Äôs 20-25% guaranteed interest.
72,@BIGJCRYPT0 None
73,@kirubaakaran @AntonKreil
74,"@SahilBloom @morganhousel Diversifying. Low risk stocks, high risk stocks, decent bond yields, real estate counter inflation, and smart tax strategies"
75,@TokunboAdesina Look at our discretionary fiscal. It‚Äôs insane
76,"@emmanuelokoli_c @TokunboAdesina Regardless you should be invested in assets, not in the bank, which there should be records kept"
77,"@TokunboAdesina Investing, IRAs, retirement, taxation etc should however be taught to more teens so they understand much better how the financial markets work and how the deck is stacked against them"
78,"@adammerino Exactly, inflation rises and current prices dwindle, assets heavy into future projection suffer, seems hedging could relieve some of the damage"
79,@adammerino Heavy tech positions ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
80,@AntonKreil when are you bringing the ITPM to NYC my man?

92,@steviemctweets @NimaRoohiS @MacConwell @theaknobel with all this casual wear in the startup scene‚Ä¶could a suit be considered punk rock? ü§£
93,"@robmay No, meant more like investing in projects as well, rights acquisitions, commercial real estate developments, land rezone acquisitions, etc. All still structured like PE deals, all offering 2-3x returns but not directly a startup"
94,@jameygannon Because in NYC your Barber is an actor and your waiter is a founder too
95,@iSocialFanz Remember when I was all AIM all the time?
96,@robmay Do you only fund companies?
