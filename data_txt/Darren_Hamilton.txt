1,"@verlorkind Also, there are many ""rights"" that are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, but that does not mean that they are not protected. The 9th Amendment sees to that."
2,"@verlorkind Interpretation is key here. The ""they"" being referred to in the second sentence refers to ""the people"" of the first sentence. The same language (and intent) is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence."
3,"The axiom states you can either treat the symptoms, or find and treat its cause. In my opinion, many of the problems we have in government can be widely attributed to treating the symptoms. Perhaps it's time to look beyond the symptoms to the cause.

18,"@BuenoForMiami As we inexorably move closer toward a ""cashless"" society, I sometimes wonder how panhandlers (those ONLY asking for money) will adapt."
19,"Education seems to be on the minds of Texans as we head into this election year. One area is *how* and another is *what* to teach our children. Both of these come into play if we are bold enough to innovate our education systems for the 21st century.

21,"@Baldprivilege I think the ""v"" is supposed to be lower-cased, but I could be wrong."
22,"@Gear6A IMHO, Goldberg (and most of Hollywood) exist in an environment that focuses on the superficial instead of the substantive. It's okay to have an opinion, but she shouldn't try to pass herself off as an expert on a topic (history) outside of her bailiwick (entertainment)."

37,"@LarrySharpe In my (admittedly limited) experience, this is primarily the result of a lack of insight. This reminds me of a televised interview of a girl who claimed that ""there will always be a 1%"" without realizing that, if those people leave, she might then become that 1% she so despised."

49,"@DanForTexas Um, not to put too fine a point on it but that's not a 'resolution'; it's just a statement. A resolution would be stated like 'I will accept that chocolate syrup is an acceptable salad dressing.' Frankly, what surprises me is that you ever thought it wasn't."
50,"@beinlibertarian Yes, Lincoln was a Republican, but (to be fair) in 1860, Republicans were ""radically progressive abolitionists"" while the Democrats were the ""die-hard, militant conservatives""."

62,"@Indepentarian Perhaps not, but at least I am actually working to make a difference. What are you actually doing (other than being a troll)?"
63,"@Indepentarian Until you actually stand up and present yourself to the electorate as a candidate, your opinions (such as they are) appear to have all of the effect of ""shouting at the rain"". I question whether anyone actually endorses your capricious diatribes."
64,"@Indepentarian @VoteScheirman @fakertarians @Indepentarian, at least @VoteScheirman is clearly making an attempt to substantively change the political narrative whereas you are simply a troll who actively shuns any real participation in the process, yet continues to make judgments about those who DO participate."
65,"@Indepentarian @VoteScheirman This is typical trolling behavior; state an unsubstantiated claim, then leave it to others to try to interpret your intent. Either state your disagreement clearly, @Indepentarian, or do everyone a favor and delete yourself from the platform."
