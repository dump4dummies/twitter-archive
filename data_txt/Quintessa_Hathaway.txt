November 8 is our time to chart a new path Forward as we lay hold on the promises of democracy. #AR02 deserves more than what it has been given since January 3, 2011 &amp; January 3, 2015!

1,"@AOC, #AR02 is the only district with over 10% of the population is African American &amp; has never elected a person of color, including during Reconstruction. In 2020, Democrats gained ground &amp; the Republican supermajority divided Pulaski County into 3 congressional districts."
2,"@RepAOC, the egregious anti-reproductive rights issue is critical. Also, the Second Congressional District was redistricted based on racial gerrymandering. Gov. @AsaHutchinson refused to sign it into law. We are fighting for fair maps.

4,"This is a defining moment for our democracy. Everything we care about regarding privacy is on the line. It is time to make progress on the central issue of gender equality. Democratic wins in November forces the minority to hear the voices of the majority of Arkansans, Americans. https://t.co/VN94ngeTF4"
5,"To invalidate his marriage would be in contrast to the ultraconservative agenda he is mandated to follow. He lost his way a long time ago. He represents all that is against progress, racial uplift, and human decency. My fellow Democrats and I must win in November. https://t.co/MQBPBaN7ao"

21,"On this day in 2015, America was shocked by a heinous massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The acts of white supremacist reveal we struggle with and are greatly distorted by race &amp; class in this country. #LestWeForget #Charleston9"
22,"On the 50th anniversary of the #Watergate Break-In, we see its spirit hanging over and intersecting the #January6thHearings.

89,"The #2022Midterms will unleash a cathartic stream of consciousness. Our choices are clear and Tuesday, May 24 demonstrated it. 
There were Democratic uncontested races and we won without runoffs in federal and gubernatorial ones. The Republican machine outnumbered us 3:1."
90,"We value a growing thriving middle class.
We value academic excellence for all schoolchildren in a safe and secure learning environment.
We value the ""beloved communities"" and affluent ones equally. 
We value pocketbook issue that touch our families and those who are single."
91,"Hierarchy of human values suggests we examine and reckon with our needs, interests, aspirations, and how we are socialized. Arkansas, America is going through this now! We have a unique opportunity to be a blue state again. We value reproductive freedom and gun reform."
92,"The most fundamental right in any democracy is the right to vote. There is no explicit, fundamental, affirmative, individual, citizenship or federal right to vote in this nation. It is a state right. American history shows us the power of ""state's rights."""
93,"The attitudes and beliefs about the press we experienced for four (4) years were benighted. Misinformation and disinformation will become routine. Our commentators and investigative journalist, left leaning, moderate, and progressive press will have heavy tasks before them."
94,"No one in Arkansas, or on the planet, wants their lives, images, or property threatened. There are ideas and deep seated feelings that all Arkansans and Americans share. We love family, faith, fun, and freedom. That is enmeshed in our social fabric and Constitution."
95,"We are living in some historic and revolutionary times. Worldviews about race, class, gender and sex, women's liberation, and our understandings are being challenged litigiously and places we visit and utilize daily."
96,Those actions show that Arkansas politics has the potentiality to swell in a similar manner if Republicans choose not to concede or accept the results of elections this Fall or in any future election.
97,"There was real fear and lives lost on January 6, 2021. America experienced an attempt to overthrow democracy in a way which has never been seen. Let us remember that the Confederate flag was flown in our nation's Capitol and it did not during the height of the Civil War."
98,"The Republican gubernatorial nominee is a member of the previous presidential administration. She spoke to his agenda and shares his ideology. If given the opportunity, she will execute it as a statement of loyalty and an expression of conservative values."
99,"Arkansas will be the test case for a second term of the former president in a 2024 election bid and the current congressional delegation will fall in line. 
Let's Turn Arkansas Blue Come November 2022. Make Hathaway The New Way!
