0,@jtwilcox111 This is despicable.  Glad that their efforts failed thanks to masonry floors. Let us know when the perpetrators are arrested.
1,@Jim_Brunner @GovInslee @seattletimes @JacksonMaynard8 @BIAW2 @AGCofWashington thank you for fighting this end run around the legislature and industry stakeholders.
2,@GKanenwisher @GovInslee @dorimonson Only the ones that he couldn’t get even the Democratic controlled  legislature to pass.
3,@MikeFancher He should have to pay the settlement instead of the taxpayers.  Maybe then it would actually have an impact.
4,"For all of his hand-wringing about threats to our democracy, this end-run around the legislature is one more evidence of his autocratic mentality. https://t.co/zZfvz337DQ"
5,@stevemgordon67 Remember when Democrats called Republican grassroots efforts “astroturf?”  Isn’t that what Nick Hanauer is doing when he gives over $600K (x2 for the other family member who matched his donation) to an anti gun initiative traen encourages harassment to raise the cost for others?
6,"@BrandiKruse @Jim_Brunner The KXLY article appears to have been removed so I can’t see what it said.  Incidentally, I received an email about my own page a few days ago that looked suspicious and forwarded it to Facebooks phishing scam address."
7,"@ScottAdamsSays I support personal choice. If it makes them more comfortable to mask, that is fine.  Those who prefer not to should have had a choice all along.  If the fact that someone is unmasked bothers you, maintain your distance."
8,It was heartwarming to watch the sincere outpouring of support for the family of Deputy Dom Calatas family.  @brucedammeier hadn't even finished asking and most of the room already had their paddles up to donate. @PierceCountyGOP supports those who protect our community. https://t.co/XLYMNaogk1
9,@MGammax3 @jtwilcox111 I’m pretty sure that one is Jesse Johnson who was the prime sponsor of many of the “police reform” bills that have been a disaster.
10,Democrats keep raising taxes and blocking every Republican effort to provide real tax relief to working Americans - and then they lie to you about it. https://t.co/1mAtcfXp4V
11,He is literally bragging on the Senate floor about overturning the will of the voters.  This is the same party that keeps publicly wringing their hands about “threats to our democracy.” They ARE the threat to our democracy.  Remember in November. https://t.co/hTmJ3BNLaM
12,Remember in November! https://t.co/FPAqPjMSS2
13,@Whoanow8 @hitEsc @AGOWA There are many good reasons for law abiding people to have firearms.  Self defense is a primary one.  A standard capacity magazine for most firearms is more than the 10 rounds in this legislation.  This makes it easier for criminals to attack a less prepared victim.
14,@AGOWA It’s very telling that SB 5407 - which would have punished criminals using a stolen weapon- was killed in committee but the ban of standard capacity magazines advanced.  They don’t want to stop crime.  They only want to make things difficult for the law abiding.
