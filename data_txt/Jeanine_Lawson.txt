Check out some of the highlights in the thread below 👇 https://t.co/rcgpAJxlvs https://t.co/PRkTQPgAA3"
37,“I am unequivocally and unapologetically a defender or babies in the womb. Wexton is the darling of Planned Parenthood in the same way she’s the darling of LGBTQ activists. I will have no problem having it out with her on the behalf of innocent babies.”
38,"“If the National Organization of Women really cared about women, they would be front and center with me fighting this transgender nonsense.”"
39,“Jennifer Wexton has run two campaigns on Green New Deal policies. Now she’s trying to role it back by supporting Governor Youngkin’s gas tax relief. We need to hold her accountable this November.”
40,"“I was happy to sign the Energy Independence Pledge a few months ago, I fully believe that we need to become energy independent. We need to stop importing and capitalize on our natural resources domestically, including federal land. Drill baby drill.”"
41,"“Congress has the power of the purse. A good way to affect local change is to defund localities that aren’t looking out for us, and that’s exactly what I’ll do as your representative.”"
42,"“Under the Biden administration, just under ARPA, Prince William County received $90 million. This has to stop. They’ve pushed so much money into the economy, it’s part of why we’re seeing prices skyrocket. We have to get this reckless spending under control.”"
43,"“Where is Wexton? Seriously, she’s nowhere. She’s been MIA with everything going on in Loudoun County, and she’s buddies with Buta Biberaj. 

I can tell you, as supervisor I have always held regular town halls. My door is always open and I govern close to the people.”"
44,"“Ladies, you can count on me to defend our gender. I will not allow the left to erase us. And I will not allow men to play women’s sports. Full stop.”"
45,“I look forward to one of our first votes when Republicans take back Congress being to finish the wall and secure our border.”

70,"Seems like Biberaj knew that she would be disqualified, (as she should), and they’ve lined up an alternate with a different name to execute her woke agenda. We need to reject the idea that this replacement qualifies as independent in any way. (2/3)"
71,"Why did the judge in the case to remove Atoosa Reaser appoint a new special prosecutor who is ALSO @ButaBiberaj’s fellow member of Virginia Progressive Prosecutors for Justice - a group of only 12 CAs out of the 132 localities in Virginia? (1/3)
