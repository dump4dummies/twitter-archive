Discourage abortions by building a society where everyone may flourish, not depriving women of the choice. Depriving women of the choice is dangerous to freedom. https://t.co/qGtAsHkwAw"

Overturning Roe harms America. It makes our Country more unequal and less free.

5,"Again, to be pro-choice is not to be pro-abortion; it is pro-liberty, pro-freedom, and pro-women‚Äôs rights.

There are better ways to promote birth w/o revoking the right, inc. passing the social and economic legislations that many lawmakers are staunchly against."
23,"For the few cases where women are unfortunately pressured into an abortion, making abortions illegal is not the correct approach.

I, personally, am actually anti-abortion, esp. after the 15-week mark, but that does not justify stripping the right from our Constitution."
