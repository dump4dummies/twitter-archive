Discourage abortions by building a society where everyone may flourish, not depriving women of the choice. Depriving women of the choice is dangerous to freedom. https://t.co/qGtAsHkwAw"
3,"S/o to Puffy (@diddy), today and always, 👏🏽. https://t.co/OBjo2uG5wx"
4,"Disagree w/ a woman’s choice all you would like, but depriving her of an actual choice is undermining our Nation’s values of freedom and, therefore, undermining our US Constitution.

Overturning Roe harms America. It makes our Country more unequal and less free.

#CodifyRoe"
5,"Again, to be pro-choice is not to be pro-abortion; it is pro-liberty, pro-freedom, and pro-women’s rights.

Discourage abortions by providing opportunities and expanding social safety nets and resources, not making abortions illegal. This is America, the land of the free. https://t.co/VBtywogXlm"

#CodifyRoe"
10,"Their opinion on a precedent of over half a century that has expanded liberty, freedom, and choice is invalid.

All of us must act. The lives of the women who are in danger depends on all of us acting. Codify Roe. Democrats have the majority. It is possible.

#CodifyRoe"
11,"When one deliberately lies to Congress to secure an appointment onto the/our SCOTUS, then he or she becomes an illegitimate Supreme Court Justice.

There are folks on our Nation’s highest Court who are there illegitimately. These people lied and misled.

12,"There are more than enough resources and legislative options to make sure that this Supreme Court does not continue to undermine the USA people and our people’s rights.

Our Nation is less free and more unequal b/c of the five SC Justices; they are undermining the Constitution."
13,"I will be the one to say it — @potus @joebiden is hardly doing enough during this national crisis, because a crisis, indeed, it is.

22,"Being pro-life does not justify forcing women, particularly poor and working-class women, to carry a pregnancy through.

There are better ways to promote birth w/o revoking the right, inc. passing the social and economic legislations that many lawmakers are staunchly against."
23,"For the few cases where women are unfortunately pressured into an abortion, making abortions illegal is not the correct approach.

I, personally, am actually anti-abortion, esp. after the 15-week mark, but that does not justify stripping the right from our Constitution."
24,"Everything that Candace (@RealCandaceO) mentioned on the beauty and the miracle of motherhood can coexist with not stripping folks of the choice and the freedom, for doing so puts many other liberties at-risk (incl. same-sex marriage)."
25,"I can respect everything that @RealCandaceO just stated on her Instagram Live, but none of that justifies endangering social liberties and stripping folks of their choice.
