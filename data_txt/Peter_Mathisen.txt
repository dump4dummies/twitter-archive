1,@NathanTylerLee @AskFrontier Oak Glen feels your pain! Lost ours about 7PM..
2,@AskFrontier Once again service is out and no way to get an update or get a hold of escalations. They're 'Busy i was told. Anyone else been told by Frontier line techs to destroy the network equipment to 'do everyone a favor or is that just me?... #frontiersucks #FCC #cpuc
3,@AskFrontier with the amount of downtime on your services (to the point that @downdetector has a baseline of 12 outages per hour before it's considered a 'problem') how long until @californiapuc gets involved and sorts this nightmare out? #FrontierChapter11 #highspeedinternot
4,Heartfelt thanks to the fire and forestry workers who have done what they can with resources available. But there were far too many scenes like this in the early hours of the morning where crews were present but not actively engaging the fire #ElDoradoFire #smh #nofireprotection https://t.co/sQtLsK7Qyu
5,@ACLU @BernieSanders This is why we're informing those in our district and getting every eligible voter we can to register! #felonsfordoober
6,"RT @ACLU: Many felony disenfranchisement laws were passed during the Jim Crow era with the intent to bar minorities from voting.

8,"Seeing folks called out for using a PC term in a day and age where every digital utterance is dissected, makes me think that some of these folks need to go reread the gospel of Matthew, specifically 7:4 or they could just be Christlike instead of Christian üëÄ #EasterWorshippers"
9,"@RedTRaccoon Stories like this are a salve for the soul, it's good to see people of all ages realizing that the powers that be may not have their best interests at heart. I hope more people break with party lines altogether and we see a surge in independent/3rd party candidates! #cutyourties"

11,@runforsomething I'm glad to see people in this great nation both young and old finally getting the impetus to challenge the status quo and demand a more egalitarian administration! #dooberforcongress

As long as we embrace ignorance we don't deserve freedom."
13,"@BernieSanders The real solution is to elect representatives that truly are a member of their community not just their city council or county board. Stop ICEE politics demand more choices, vote for third party candidates, destabilize the two party system!"

21,"@maxxfiend @AOC I hope one day we can take a page from Cheif Seattle's playbook and remember 'We have not inherited the earth, we are borrowing it from our children'. I believe that we can move forward in a sane and safe fashion, though many of the increasingly geriatric legislatures prevent it."
22,@BernieSanders Let's not throw caution to the wind and let folks come together naturally with guidance instead of mandate. #dooberforcongress
23,"@humourme1234 Too bad nobody down here follows Canadian politics closer, theres a few things we could learn from our northern neighbors (our southern ones too) #dooberforcongress"
24,"@maxxfiend @AOC I'll not argue that, hence the analogy. Grassroots movements need to grow organically, otherwise there are often hurt feelings when things move to fast without considering all angles. I spent a few seasons in Shinnston WV slinging sandwiches to those Miners and I can relate."

32,"@AOC @RashidaTlaib Do what you feel best represents your electorate, if its impeachment proceedings so be it, if it fails so be it. Don't be afraid to do what you are elected to do. While I don't have to love everyone's opinion, I'll die fighting for their right to have it! #dooberforcongress"
33,"@TheLoneWolf1995 @BernieSanders Thanks for your support, as a Non-partisan Candidate I'll take it where I can get it ü§£ü§£ü§£"
34,"@TheLoneWolf1995 @BernieSanders Consider this however, the congressional district I'm making a bid for is literally larger than Ireland. A single congressional seat over 82,000 sq km"
35,"@Acosta Reading it tonight, might be through tomorrow depending on how heavily redacted it actually is, but so far Vol 1 is looking fairly intact, and a bit damning as well. I wouldn't hold it against ol Donnie to dodge a bit lol"
36,@TheLoneWolf1995 @BernieSanders I'm Canadian by birth but lived in US most of my life. It seems like a no brainer that if ignored too long may generate more pushback than our current administration can handle (we can only hope) I have friends who pay over 600$/mo for subpar govt mandated pvt insurance.

39,"@MarioLomuscio @BernieSanders Say hello to more kiosks in lieu of cashiers and self checkout at places you wouldn't expect. Watch the youth become more apathetic and suicidal, as if being young in this day and age isn't hard enough. #dooberforcongress #cutyourties"
40,"@kalodimas @BernieSanders @POTUS @VP @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That's 1275 if you can find an employer willing to work you full time. While unemployment is bad, underemployment is almost worse. Many in my state must work several part-time jobs to get by as there are not as many full time positions as there were 20 years ago."
41,"@phillyfanvhs @BernieSanders Yep, watch the Mom and Pops, shut their doors and the Dems serve America up to the Corporations on a silver platter. Who needs competition in a market when you can have complicity. The only way to fix our economy is to reign in this rampant globalization."
42,"@Ritchnasty @BernieSanders Minimum wage laws hurt more than help, wonder what it'll take to get the Dems to stop backing them. Wage isn't the issue it's the lack of support services and the profit motive that keep the American way of life from improving. The further we get from our agrarian roots..."
43,@LayherDaddy @BernieSanders And these corporate giants will only be willing to employ you 20hrs/a week to avoid paying benefits or providing a living wage. Unfortunately our current economy may see Zimbabwe level inflation before long if these balances aren't made soon
44,"@Tedrickdancin @KamalaHarris That's why we must speak up and stand up if need be, I'm thankful for every free minded voter like you that is willing to voice their outrage with a system that has selectively disenfranchised them"
45,@Tedrickdancin @KamalaHarris This is why us Non-partisan Candidates need your attention. The swamp has as many flavors as an icee machine. #dooberforcongress

47,"@BernieSanders Partisan politics need to die, so much interest is vested in the Executive campaigns that many are distracted from local efforts that would help bring TRUE balance to the legislative branch and end this dualist adventure we've been swept into. Stock the pond and reap the reward!"
48,"@therefore_I_M @Momisbuff @BernieSanders Gotta vote your conscience not along partisan lines, as a Californian I have the luxury of throwing my presidential vote towards who I actually support since elections are gamed and the popular vote doesn't matter. Change needs to happen at the district level. #dooberforcongress"
49,"@Mocogurl @BernieSanders This is definitely a divisive take from Bernie, we definitely need to step away from partisan politics but many of the older generations are frightened by their unease with today's youth culture. Keep backing independents and run for office yourself if need be #dooberforcongress"

53,"@JohnLukeNYC The Establishment has rigged their own system there are fewer options for fixing it with each passing election. Partisan politics and rigged elections are SOP in the current climate. That's why I'm running for Congress, to be part of the solution instead of lying down another day"
54,@BernieSanders I guess after a couple hundred years the descendants of revolutionaries that started this nation and others have forgotten their roots and become comfortable in the seats of their former 'masters'. Time to take their seats again I suppose...
