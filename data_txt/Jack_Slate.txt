2,"@LCDCAlabama Well, technically, there’s nothing illogical about the statement. A total ban is still “some”, logically speaking.

5,"@aprylmarie @TabithaK @BaldwinDemsAL @jeff_poor @WaltMaddox You have no right to inspect someone’s genitals when they tell you they belong to some gender. Since 100% of people aren’t easily categorizable into two genders, and since you can’t invade their privacy to check, you ought to just take their word for it instead of making a fuss."

9,"@aprylmarie @TabithaK @BaldwinDemsAL @jeff_poor @WaltMaddox Well, I think it at least blurs any concrete definition of what a woman is, and I think, for the same reasons, it blurs any definition of what a man is. So, at that point, what specific thing exclusively differentiates all men from all women?"
10,@aprylmarie @TabithaK @BaldwinDemsAL @jeff_poor @WaltMaddox What about intersex people? There are literally people born with XX chromosomes and have a penis.
