43,"@ericcbarnes General Rule of Thumb: if it's a three-letter agency, then it's probably worth sytematically dissolving. Our economy is being stymied by a growing number of govt regulators. They need to get out of the way and let the free market thrive and innovate unburdened."
44,"@ericcbarnes You appear stuck on a false equivalence. 16A is *individual income* taxation. Feds can levy tarrifs and compete in the free market. You'd also be amazed how wastefully bloated the fed govt has become over time. Spending must be cut dramatically, revenue isn't the problem."
45,"@ericcbarnes I'm sure you can understand the difference between tarrifs collected on imported goods, vs an income tax levied on individuals as codified by 16A. Not sure how foreign tax laws are relevant. I'm quite a fan of tarrifs, but utterly despise income taxation."
46,"@ericcbarnes You didn't ask a question -- more of a demand. You're also wrong: the first (temporary) federal income tax wasn't levied until 1861. The annual, eternal income tax came in 1915. It hasn't always been this way, and it's possible to go back."
47,@ericcbarnes Imagine a country where a centralized agency cannot tax your hard-earned income to fund its pet projects and reckless spending. That's America's reality if we ever abolished 16A.
48,@JesseKellyDC More like the 16th Amendment! Federal taxation is theft.
