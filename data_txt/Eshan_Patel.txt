51,@sdbaral @ACasadevall1 @andrewpekosz @ShohamTxID @DenaliBoon @Andy_Redd Another caveat is that this table is correlating OD values from tests designed to be qualitative (Ab+/-) (impact is unclear).
52,"@sdbaral @ACasadevall1 @andrewpekosz @ShohamTxID @DenaliBoon @Andy_Redd Thanks, Stef! Great paper, but I think hard to conclude much from this table since assays shown are targeting diff antigens and/or measuring diff antibodies (IgA vs IgG) known to have diff longitudinal dynamics (see Fig2). So I‚Äôd expect variability!"

54,"TL;DR - To detect IgG/total Abs, there was variable sensitivity (76%-94%) &amp; specificity (87%-99.6%). Degree of correlation (&amp; AUROC) btwn EIA results &amp; neutralizing titers also differed by assay. Some EIAs may be useful to identify convalescent donors w/ high neutralizing titers."
