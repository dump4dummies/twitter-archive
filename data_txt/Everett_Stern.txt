4,RT @Marina4Colorado: We need a complete list of Congresspersons that asked for a pardon. #ProsecuteAllTraitors
5,The Supreme Court is out of its mind. Democracy must HOLD THE LINE!!!!!
6,It does not make sense that a Russian Diplomat living in Moscow also with residence in FL who has close ties to Putin: Still has a U.S. Citizenship. Google Oleg Firer &amp; see he is taking orders from the Kremlin. He is part of a Miami Spy Ring &amp; Organized Crime. Enemy of Democracy. https://t.co/0d2jxuE3p3
7,"Oleg Firer, Kenges Rakishev, &amp; Mike Zoi are members of the board of Net Element. Above listed especially Oleg Firer have connections with the Russian government (Putin) &amp; organized crime. How are they involved with NASDAQ? American Democracy is under fire by the Russians."
8,@CobraKai_Elite @Gauth23Z @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov My hedge fund does not have a position in $MULN. I am not shorting the stock. Look at the facts. This is not about trying to stop some kind of rally or stop the stock from going down. I could care less.
9,"Other investors in Mullen Technologies $MULN such as Drawbridge Investments, LLC, Esousa Holdings, LLC, Ceocast, Inc &amp; Ault Global Holdings, Inc have been a part of Net Element in the past and have a history of fraud and investor manipulation."
10,"Oleg Firer (Russian Diplomat) &amp; other directors of NETE owned a majority share of Mullen Technology. Brenton Wilcoxon, owner of Next Metal Ltd and Next Chemx, is partnering with MULN to help provide battery technology and materials to $MULN."
11,"On 31 August 2021, Mullen Technologies merged with merger with Net Element (NETE) a company, owned by Oleg Firer. Firer has also been found by Tactical Rabbit to have connections to Russian Organized Crime and the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)."
12,Multiple sources indicate that Mullen Technologies has cultivated partnerships and investments from individuals with connections to Russian government officials and organized criminal groups.
13,@lazyhustler_zzz @kellygirl2600 I would check your facts on that. What you are describing is stock manipulation and I do not do that. I am not being paid to tweet about this. My first intel report came out I think 2 years ago about Net Element. The stock the MULN did a reverse merger into.
14,@ethsbythelake @Steebles1 @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov Oleg Firer is a criminal and spy working against the United States. I care about his operations. I heard Oleg Firer stole from MULEN. Check out my substack. I worked with the FBI on this matter and while I appreciate optics I have to stay focused on just doing the right thing.
15,@ethsbythelake @Steebles1 @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov Correct. The reason is not because of stock price. It has to do with ongoing investigations.
16,@Gauth23Z @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov I do not care if the stock goes up or down in price. It does not matter to me. You are missing the point. I care about protecting our Democracy and right now the Russians are undermining Democracy through the stock market and BS shell companies.
17,@Steebles1 @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov Please do your homework and you will see Oleg Firer is still involved. I posted an intel report on my Substack. It is free. I would not be making public statements of this gravity if I did not have anything to back it up.
18,@Steebles1 @sddphoto @FBI @USTreasury @SECGov No I am not shorting the stock.
19,@HiJing123 @BullLogic $MULN is involved. Look into their SEC docs. You will see Oleg Firer is still involved with the company. I am not playing stocks here. I am just looking out for our financial system. We cannot have Russian Interference in our stock markets.
20,@RubyFlower16 @Nasdaq @NasdaqExchange All Americans need to research this situation carefully. Alot of people are about to lose their money or already have. I am not involved in these dealings. I came across Oleg Firer about a year ago in another intel operation. I looked into him further and notified the FBI.
21,@cre8fire It is a very big deal. And everyone should be paying close attention. I worked with the FBI on this and the SEC. This is a serious situation. I encourage Americans to do their own research into the matter and you will find what I am saying is true.
22,@BullLogic Hit piece? No. This is fact that Oleg Firer and his Kremlin-backed cronies are ripping off Americans and harming the American economic system.

41,@kellygirl2600 The American People are being stolen from.  Fake stocks are being invested in. Pump and dump schemes. American financial information is being stolen.
42,I am sending out a clear warning to the American Public. SVR which is Russian Intelligence has penetrated our financial system and the Russian Oligarchs are using certain NASDAQ companies to launder the funds. I was right about HSBC bank... Research Oleg Firer and his operations.
43,If you stand for Democracy then join me in fighting Russian disinformation and spies here in the U.S. Russian Intelligence (SVR) has a spy ring in Miami and they are getting BS stocks on NASDAQ to launder money and send it back to Russia. Oleg Firer is a key player.
44,"Research Oleg Firer Russian Diplomat &amp; Spy against the U.S. See the threat, especially to our financial system. All the $ is going back to Russia... It is called money laundering &amp; securities fraud.  He resides in Moscow working against the U.S, but still has citizenship here?"
45,How can a Russian Diplomat &amp; Spy for Putin maintain his U.S Citizenship? Look into Oleg Firer. See the FBI Arrest and investigations. Look at the companies he is part of and how Russia through Oleg Firer are harming the United States. We have to protect our Democracy.
46,People who have no hope are easy to control… the people who have the control; have the power! -Never Ending Story. Don’t ever lose hope. Don’t end up losing control of your freedoms.
47,J6 Vs. Flynn
48,J6 committee already mentioned a key player I testified against. Ivan Raiklin. I am the one that exposed him and the Domestic terror group he is running on behalf of Flynn. J6 needs to work with DOJ and stop these terrorists including Flynn. I am looking forward to the future.
49,The Guardian and New York Times both reported on my evidence and the threat of ongoing domestic terrorism from Flynn on behalf of Trump and Americans still do not seem to get it… Democracy is under attack now! Major attacks are coming.
50,"The threat against Democracy is not old news. Trump &amp; Flynn J6 attack is NOT old news. I witnessed, gathered evidence, &amp; testified that the coup to overturn the election is ongoing. Myself &amp; Fmr CIA station chief were “recruited” to help overturn / Domestic Terror well after J6."
51,"Donald Trump, and General Flynn running a Domestic terror group are a clear and present danger to the National Security of the United States."
52,"@ProjectLincoln Drag me through the streets... Go for it. I am protecting Democracy and I will give my life defending it, but I promise I or the Pro-Democracy supporters out there will not go quietly into the night."
53,RT @ProjectLincoln: The choice is the same as it’s been since 2016: America or Trump https://t.co/box0HTcEpd
54,"Senior Executive Service FBI Agent ""Everett, Never Give Up. Keep going and Never Give Up."" I now say to everyone who is Pro-Democracy and anti-extremism: ""Never Give Up. Keep going and Never Give Up."" The enemies of Democracy are a house of cards held up with disinformation."
55,We are a Nation and people at war. A war for Democracy. There will be no defining battles. No clear victories. A war largely fought in the Shadows. We owe it to future generations ensuring a good life and establishing a world of peace to win this War for Democracy.

66,@SandySkipper1 @pewtergod @MatthewsMarilyn Judge me for my real actions. Not some tweets orchestrated by others 2 years ago. I also see people criticizing for certain shows I went on years ago. I went on the shows the PR firm told me to. It is that simple. Does not define who I am or what I believe in. My actions define.
67,"@SandySkipper1 @pewtergod @MatthewsMarilyn When you run for office you have to be a puppet. I was told in order to win the nomination I had to win over Trumpers. I couldnt look myself in the mirror as I cant say things I dont believe. I decided to be myself and not a politician. I took on Flynn, Trump, &amp; Stone head-on."
68,@SandySkipper1 @pewtergod @MatthewsMarilyn I am the one that suspended the other accounts because they were hacked. I reached out to Twitter and asked for them to be deactivated. I could not get access.
69,@SandySkipper1 @pewtergod @MatthewsMarilyn I obviously do not hold these views. Remember campaigns are run by others. I talk about this in my book and the dissatisfaction of being defined as this right-winger. I also was trying to get in with Flynn around this time.

83,@bullish_anon Let me give you advice. Don’t focus on the negatives about me. Focus on yourself and finding purpose and meaning in your life. Fight for something. Don’t just tear people down. Focus on helping yourself and the community around you. Earn the appreciation of honest critics.
84,@bullish_anon I am used to people like you. Haters and nay sayers never get anywhere in life. I am out here trying to make something of myself and fight for a greater cause. I am risking my life. Anyone who knows me or has followed me understands I am a sincere fighter.

91,@nickmortensen The filter was like a giant excel spreadsheet controlled by Customer Alert Monitoring Program. It was not a Boolean Search type system. A wire came in and if there was an exact hit on the wire filter then it was rejected. The problem was everything was going through.
92,"The terrorist financing money at HSBC was going towards terror orgs where they were making the IED's to blow up our troops. I promise every soldier injured &amp; the families of those fallen heroes that I took ACTION to stop the bank. I cannot go into details, but I fought hard."
93,@jsg333 It was not so easy at the time. Sometimes the easiest trick can be the hardest to find. I couldn't figure out how they were getting these transactions through.  The wire filter was only an exact match. It took a while to figure it out. Plus I had to get access to the systems.
94,RT @john_sipher: Ugh  https://t.co/RMIxry6PlH
95,"This is how I figured out how HSBC bank was moving billions of dollars for terrorists &amp; drug cartels. I passed the information to the CIA &amp; did everything to stop the bank.

97,"I remember 10 years ago as the HSBC Whistleblower I went to the FBI Federal building in Philadelphia. Engraved on the wall with a giant seal of the United States it says ""Justice is the Defense of our Liberty."" I sure hope the DOJ glances up at the wall every once in a while..."
98,@piyushmittal @deejay90192 This is disgusting. Flynn and Stone belong in jail. That is where I am going to send them.
