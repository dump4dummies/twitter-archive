1,"Support candidates who support women by contributing to their campaigns, knocking doors, &amp; getting voters to the polls.  Support organizations on the front lines, such as @PPFA. We cannot fall into despair. We have to take action and get involved, even more than ever before."
2,"Today is a dark day for our country, for women &amp; especially for women in poverty &amp; for women of color who will be most devastatingly impacted by the Dobbs decision. But we must channel our righteous anger into action. I feel like I‚Äôm preaching to the choir, but elections matter."
3,"But Roe and Casey were decided from a larger fundamental right to privacy. Encompassed in this constitutional right to privacy are other rights, such as the right to use birth control or the right to same-sex marriage. Dobbs is clear that other privacy rights are now insecure."
4,"By overturning Roe and Casey, the Supreme Court has relegated women to inferior status relative to our male counterparts. We no longer have a right to bodily autonomy. The majority states that abortion is not ‚Äúdeeply rooted‚Äù in our country‚Äôs history."
5,"Today‚Äôs Dobbs decision is an egregious abomination filled with distortions and faulty reasoning. Roe &amp; Casey recognized a woman‚Äôs right to bodily autonomy, and from that, a woman‚Äôs right to make her own deeply personal decision about whether she was forced to carry a pregnancy."

On average, Native women earn 60 cents for every $1.00 paid to white men. This systemic oppression and gender inequality create insurmountable barriers to achieving economic security for Native women. 

Pay Native Women. Pay us equally."
