0,"@MeetThePress @RepAOC @AOC Please educate us all on where in their confirmation hearings that Gorsuch or Kavanaugh said they would vote to uphold Roe. They said it was precedent, which it was, just like Plessy was precedent for half a century before it was overturned. No lies, except from you."
1,"@SpeakerPelosi claims overturning Roe is an @GOP attempt to “criminalize health freedom,” yet she supports forced vaccinations. Hypocrite?"
2,@POTUS Another lie!
3,@FoxNews I think she should move to Afghanistan so she can test her theory.
4,@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris No it doesn’t. Stop lying! Read Alito’s decision.
5,"For those who desperately cling to abortion as a “constitutional” right, why is one life worth more or less than another?"
6,All these world leaders criticizing SCOTUS for the Roe reversal have greater restrictions on abortion than most US states. This is nothing more than the anti-Americanism we always see… and @POTUS &amp; his cronies are leading the way! Disgraceful!
7,"Anyone who thinks corporations paying for employee travel to have abortions is a moral decision is fooling themselves. It’s a business decision 
b/c abortions r much cheaper than employees having babies &amp; taking leaves. Woke Corps would rather have babies killed than pay 4 them."
8,"@IlhanMN @IlhanMN Learn before you speak… we don’t live in a democracy. It’s a republic. Ur ignorance is almost as vast as ur anti-Americanism and anti-semitism.

It was SCOTUS that overturned the wrongfully decided Plessy, &amp; the same for the wrongfully decided Roe. It’s called progress!"
9,"@Sen_JoeManchin @Sen_JoeManchin if you are against SCOTUS overturning long-term precedent, do you think the court was wrong in overturning the segregation of Plessy v. Ferguson? That was stare decisis for almost 50 years."
10,"@Sen_JoeManchin @Sen_JoeManchin You know this decision does not make abortion illegal, so stop trying to win back the anti-life Dems that hate you with political spin."
11,@POTUS @JoeBiden Where in the Constitution is there listed a right to an abortion? NOWHERE! No constitutional right was taken away by SCOTUS. Are you undermining the Supreme Court? R you attempting to lead an insurrection against the rule of law? We might need a select committee!
12,"@mkraju @AOC is a moron. She complains there are no checks and balances but she cries for packing the court, eliminating the filibuster, new state hoods, &amp; blanket amnesty to create a one-party state. Checks and balances?"
13,@WhiteHouse @WhiteHouse End your war on US energy and let us drill! BTW… nobody believes your line blaming Putin for inflation and gas prices that were already rising before he invaded Ukraine. Accept responsibility and fix it! #Drillbabydrill
14,Incredibly honored to have the endorsement of the Republican Liberty Caucus of Florida in my campaign for State Representative in District 90. https://t.co/QOqC27RvAR
15,"@POTUS @POTUS What have you done in your 50+ years in Washington, DC?"
16,"@POTUS Great job so far! People can’t afford gas or groceries, our retirement investments are plummeting… did you mean that our economy will work for everyone who is not American?"
17,"Maybe this is why he is no longer a Senator!

Former Democrat senator says Biden 'saved' the economy and that it’s ‘really not doing too bad at all’

https://t.co/HP6UUlNuvA"
18,"@KatiePavlich @KatiePavlich That’s because he hates America and abhors the American military. He prefers to project American weakness, meaning honoring the brave who saved Europe from Naziism is not important for him. He prefers to commemorate woke firsts according to his identity politics."
19,@RepDonBeyer This is a politician’s underhanded way of banning guns and infringing on the second amendment. #2a #Constitution #BillOfRights
20,"@POTUS @POTUS U lefties have done a lot-end cash bail, decriminalize, don’t prosecute, let criminals back out on streets, etc. U focus on symptoms simply 2 push ur agenda, rather than focus on disease - moral decay, lack of accountability, mental health issues, breakdown of family unit"
21,@RBReich @RBReich Your socialist economics are much better… let’s punish the successful so everyone shares the same poverty and misery. Brilliant!
22,@HillaryClinton No one needs Hillary Clinton. Let’s ban her!
23,@POTUS @POTUS Stop exploiting families’ tragedies to push your anti-American agenda. Less than 3% of all murders are committed with assault rifles… what else are you going to ban? #2a
24,"@POTUS @POTUS What age can you serve in the military? If 18 year olds are not mature enough to own an assault rifle, why are we willing to send them off to war to use the same or more deadly weapons? #hypocrisy #2A"
25,"@POTUS Why were #gasprices on the rise well before Putin ever invaded Ukraine? You can blame whoever you want, Mr. President, but we all know your destructive war on American #energy is why we have record high gas prices."
26,@townhallcom Can somebody splash this guy with a dose of reality?
27,"@ArthurSchwartz @davidcicilline is exactly what is wrong with the left - no respect for the #Constitution &amp; no regard for the #rights of Americans. He is just another politician who uses human lives like pawns on a chessboard - exploiting tragedy to push his anti-American, anti-freedom ideology."
28,https://t.co/1O5mirGEkV
29,@joncoopertweets Why do we need to fly baby formula into the US in the first place?
30,"@POTUS HOW????????? You gave us your goals, but where is the plan? How are you going to lower costs?"
31,"Whoever is writing for @POTUS, do you have any idea of reality, or are you going to simply continue to recite fairy tales from your alternate reality? https://t.co/AADYkgq4YJ"
32,"@FoxNews @FoxNews And who is promoting the division and hate? It’s the left, with their identity politics, CRT, class warfare, and fake narratives of inherent and systemic racism. Americans - empower yourselves, defend America, and fight the hate and division… vote conservative!"
33,"RT @WhitlockJason: Our culture has moved such a negative direction in the last decade, I'm not sure first responders would run up in the Wo…"
34,"@staceyabrams Why should the voters trust you? You still haven’t conceded your 2018 loss with false claims of a stolen election, you falsely claimed new election laws were voter suppression (more than 2x early votes in ‘22 than ‘20), and you just admitted you hate Georgia. Great resume!"
35,"@Breaking911 @KamalaHarris @VP They are children of their #parents, and it’s the parents - not #teachers, administrators, bureaucrats, or VPs - who should be making life decisions with them. Stop your assault on #families and your war on parents’ rights! #parentsrights"
36,"Well said, @JebBush. One great governor praising another…

#Florida is a flourishing free state b/c of the foundation laid by Gov. Bush and the strength &amp; leadership of @GovRonDeSantis today.

37,@KamalaHarris Yet you support forced vaccines and mask mandates? #Hypocrite?
38,"@KamalaHarris With the exception of rape or any kind of forced sexual encounter (which is a minute portion of abortions), the woman seeking an abortion self-determined to participate in a moment of love that she knew could lead to life. Where is the infringement on her rights?"
39,@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris You are again using distortion and lies to try to gain support… overturning Roe does not make abortion illegal and you know it! Stop lying! And restricting abortion does nothing to restrict life and love - do you know how a baby is made?
40,@rebeccabguinn @danforfl @immigrants24 There IS a process for anyone who wants to come here illegally. Your excuses are why we have an illegal immigration problem. Being poor and not speaking English are not excuses for violating our laws and our sovereignty.
41,@LizaMaria5D @FreeBeacon How about a Biden speech?
42,"@FreeBeacon @FreeBeacon The imbeciles on @TheView should be the happiest to see the #MinistryOfTruth put on pause, b/c everything they say is distortion, lies, and nonsense. I would like Sunny to explain how the Dem party has moved to the center. Is it the racism or socialism?"
43,House Dem leadership refuses to allow vote on bill to protect SCOTUS unless the leaker is protected. Need any more evidence that the #Roe opinion leak was a left-wing #conspiracy that included Dem lawmakers?
44,@POTUS @POTUS Weren’t you against the busing to desegregate schools? Weren’t you worried about “racial jungles?”
45,"@RepRashida @RepRashida Indiscriminately launching rockets into civilian neighborhoods, using innocent women and children as human shields, using schools and hospitals as military installations, are considered furthering human rights and justice?"
46,@townhallcom So?
47,"Gov. Polis: “People face gut-wrenching decisions every day, whether it’s rape or incest, they’re often having to choose between the life of the mother or child.” These r a tiny minority of abortions, yet he uses them as the reason #abortion should be legal at any point up 2 birth"
48,"Anyone who disagrees with the left is denigrated with the label, “supremacist.” Our country is moving toward totalitarianism with censorship, ministry of truth, state-run media, government agencies persecuting citizens, and fixed elections. #SaveAmerica

50,"@WhiteHouse @WhiteHouse You didn’t misstate anything; you purposely lied! That’s what you have been doing to the American people for over a year. A misstatement would have been if you actually told the truth. #Bidenflation #BuildBackBroke #BidenWorstPresidentEver #Ididthat
#VoteConservative"
51,"Leslie Marshall is another dishonest lib who wants to credit Biden with fastest job creation and unemployment drop of any president. How many jobs would have been “created” if the Covid lockdowns didn’t end? Biden hasn’t created any jobs, they are just coming back from lockdowns. https://t.co/p68o2XcPGz"
52,Dems pay millions to put illegals up in hotels while Americans are homeless; take docs away from VA hospitals to serve illegals at border; stockpile #babyformula for illegals while American moms can’t get for their babies… a vote for a Dem is a vote for putting Americans last!
53,Really? No vaccine? Then what’s happening on January 13? https://t.co/9dpKO8OTLQ
54,"@WhiteHouse @FoxNews @newsmax Does the truth ever stop by @WhiteHouse ? No vaccine? Seriously? How many presidents were inaugurated as pandemic lockdowns were being lifted &amp; businesses were reopening? That’s why millions of jobs “came back,” they weren’t created! Talk about #disinformation!"
55,@MrItty @KamalaHarris The bill is called the “Women’s Health Protection Act.” How many abortions result from a threat to the mother’s health? The purpose of the bill was to expand abortion access &amp; wipe out state laws that provide restrictions on abortions… therefore it promotes abortion on demand!

58,@POTUS @POTUS You are an embarrassment to Catholics! Stop pretending you are a Catholic.
59,"@POTUS @POTUS What’s in the bill? Whoever is typing these tweets, have you read the bill? That bill is about expanding and promoting abortion, not preserving any rights. Stop lying!"
60,"@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris The majority of Americans DO NOT support #abortion on demand, for any reason and at any time during the pregnancy. A majority DOES NOT support that abortion expansion bill just voted down in the Senate."
61,The tolerant left… look at what they are saying about @Sen_JoeManchin because he has the audacity to stand by his principles and oppose their #abortionondemand bill. Manchin should switch to @GOP ; he won’t get any more abuse than he’s getting now.
62,"@townhallcom @townhallcom Did he just say he built a strong economy and the strength was #inflation ? It’s painful to watch and listen to him; his wife and all those who propped him up should be ashamed of themselves, humiliating him so they can gain the reins of power. Pathetic &amp; treasonous!"
63,"@POTUS @POTUS Please, do explain how you will achieve all these wonderful goals?"
64,@FoxNews I hope he does!
65,"@FoxNews @BretBaier Senator Murphy continues the leftist narrative distorting the Parental Rights law in FL. The law simply prevents INSTRUCTION in sexual orientation or gender identity, it does not deny services to gay or transgender students. @ChrisMurphyCT Read the bill!"
66,@ChrisMurphyCT
67,"@SenSchumer @SenSchumer Abortion is not a constitutional right and should not be a method of contraception. In most cases, it is not about health, either, so stop with the Women’s Health Protection Act, nonsense."
68,"@SenSchumer @SenSchumer If you are such a big proponent of “my body, my choice,” then why do you support mandating Americans inject an experimental vaccine into their bodies? #mandates"
69,@POTUS @POTUS It’s good to hear you believe competition is better for consumers… how about promoting #schoolchoice to build a competitive education marketplace for parents to “shop.” Empower parents to do what is best for their child’s #education needs. #ParentsRights
70,"Another Covid election? @GOP @FloridaGOP @PalmBeachGOP need 2 ensure a fair election, unlike '20 when Democrats took advantage of the pandemic to change election laws &amp; made it easier to cheat!

73,"@SenDuckworth @SenDuckworth Does the truth ever enter your mind before spewing your scare tactics? The people are tired of the left’s lies. Stop trying to scare Americans into believing the end of Roe v. Wade will be the end of all their rights. Quite frankly, it’s pathetic!"
74,"@FoxNews If u r a man &amp; have had issues w/menstruation, please let us know. I’d like 2 know how many males we can expect 2 be making use of the feminine hygiene products on which schools in Oregon will be wasting money. Education doesn’t need more $$; they need 2 use the $$ more wisely."
75,"First two things a tyrannical govt takes from the people are their arms and the free flow of information. With the new Disinformation Governance Board, Biden the Tyrant is trying to eliminate both. #2AForever #FreeSpeech #Freedom"

77,@nypost Good! Teachers should not be sharing their personal lives with students; they should be educating.
78,"@townhallcom @townhallcom What does #abortion have to do with LGBT kids in classrooms? This is typical scaremongering from a party and an ideology that can’t defend its policies, has to run from its record, and lies and cheats to stay in power. Biden is a disgrace!"

82,"@RepAdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff #Abortion is not a ""protective"" procedure for most women who choose to terminate the life inside them. Also, why are you discriminating against other ""birthing people?"" Don't you anti-science activists on the left believe all genders can give birth?"

92,@POTUS What about the doctors and lawyers you are going to give huge breaks to with you student loan forgiveness? How’s that going to help reduce the tax burden on middle/working class Americans?
93,@WhiteHouse @POTUS @WhiteHouse @POTUS How were those GDP numbers?
94,"Biden admin rails against tax cuts for wealthy but is going to cancel student debt for rich doctors &amp; lawyers while passing the bill along to working class. This means higher #debt, higher #inflation, higher #taxes. Politics at its worst. Way to go, Joe! #Bidenflation #hypocrisy"
