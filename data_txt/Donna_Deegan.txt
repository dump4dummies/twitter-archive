58,"16 cities in Florida - including Orlando, Miami, and Tampa - signed onto this @USMayors letter, but Jacksonville is shamefully absent. A universal background check system is commonsense and has bipartisan support. When I‚Äôm mayor, we‚Äôll lead on policy that reduces gun violence. https://t.co/vDFuaI3U2E"
59,This was the right decision. It gives Jacksonville voters the power to choose our next Sheriff without influence from Tallahassee and it lets Undersheriff Ivey focus on public safety as violent crime rises. https://t.co/PBgncUuRhv

72,...in a way that minimizes the impact on taxpayers. The Governor must appoint an interim sheriff who is not running for the office. Our public safety is too important for politics to drive this decision. (2/2)
73,"Sheriff Williams confirmed what was already clear in the charter. He vacated the office when he moved his residence outside of Duval County. While this unfortunate episode is happening as violent crime is rising, we can now move forward with repairing the public trust... (1/2) https://t.co/kuaEvEunW7"

78,Our city has a violent crime problem. This is the last kind of distraction we need and it‚Äôs one that will cost taxpayers dearly. But the charter is the law and it must be followed or the already broken public trust will be even harder to repair. (2/2)
79,The Jacksonville City Charter seems very clear here. As does the state law which cedes this decision to charter counties like Duval. The only question here is will the sheriff be held to the same laws he enforces. (1/2) https://t.co/4HtbkyJp5O

83,"@travisakers So great to have you back home, Travis! I‚Äôve missed that smile."
84,@JoeSampsonFL @pollamb @JulieLaGoy @NateMonroeTU I‚Äôm not saying that at all. The law should be followed. That doesn‚Äôt mean the tax payers shouldn‚Äôt know what said finger is costing them.
85,@pollamb @JulieLaGoy @NateMonroeTU It is my understanding DeSantis appoints someone to fill the office until a special election can be held. So we‚Äôd likely be looking at elections in August/November then March/May. How much will all this cost the taxpayers?

99,This is heartbreaking. Shootings like this one are happening nearly every day in Jacksonville and we're outpacing homicides from last year. The city's approach isn't working. We need a new strategy that gets to the root causes of violent crime and builds safer communities. https://t.co/wp7QOfO9M1
