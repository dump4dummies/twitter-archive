Get with Joseph Whitcomb as a law and order, but he also has a solution for the homeless and much more.  The issue is the MEDIA, they are not mentioning him anywhere!!!"
1,"@SenJeffMerkley Little Bernie, that's what they call you Jeff because they say you are left of even Bernie Sanders.  Hummm, so that would lead toward socialist or maybe communist?  Do you disavow Antifa?  Is that your stance?  Post your answer pls."

4,"Lars Larson endorsed Joseph Whitcomb for mayor of Portland Oregon, no media coverage, not in any debates!!! Get this out there, everywhere or standby for crazy next 4 years. Channel8  channel 2  why is he not in debates, people bombard them with the question. https://t.co/tNIKFGgzVt"

12,"@repblumenauer @USMarshalsHQ So Earl you are a states rights or local rights person.  That doesn't fit the progressive agenda.  I am confused, as well as many others.  I retired, we are the same age, I get it Earl and maybe time for you to join me.  retirement that is."
13,"@SenJeffMerkley Self proclaimed: Oregon Pub Broadcasting, ""The most liberal senator in congress, they call him Little Bernie""  Yikes!!  He is using fear incase you didn't recognize, which is what he does.  On the other hand you have a constitutional choice, Jo Ray Perkins.  Just sayin"
14,"@OPB I would say Earl is positioning himself to run for Governor and doesn't want the Feds to interfere with his progressive vision.  If you like democratic socialism, go for it.  If not you all need to make changes."
15,"Federal police use tear gas, crowd control munitions in S. Portland protest; 4 arrested https://t.co/kmwsKDeYJt  and on and on it goes until someone steps up to the plate.  and now https://t.co/fr9kNqsaMq"

19,"@repblumenauer yes save the restaurants, vote for Earl. WOW Trumps now throwing small business owners under the bus.  Vote for Earl. What else, oh yes turning his back on ""My"" bipartisan effort, vote for Earl.  Funny to watch from the outside."
20,@repblumenauer you all see he is deflecting to make himself more important and that he is going to solve all our problems.  You do see that don't you.  Old political move

27,"@repblumenauer What if we don't want Obamacare?  You represent me, a voting citizen in your district.  I seems to me that my voice does not count with your position on healthcare.  They say you are a nice guy, but personally I think your politics stink.  Does your wife read these posts?"
28,"@realDonaldTrump Do I have this correct? You are publicly condemning a group because you think they are dangerous.  What about BLM and Antifa?  This is a serious red flag when a US Congressman condemns a group for the way they believe and ""Might"" be dangerous.  Check you constitution. Concerned."

51,"@repblumenauer Since you haven't owned a business and haven't had a job outside government in 24years, hard for  you2understand.  If we play golf and talk about business, that cost is written off. Plus cost to get there, any other costs involved, etc.  Read the tax laws Earl, you ware me out."
52,"@repblumenauer Resist why? what? she is totally qualified.  You wear me out Earl, WOW. Readers are you there, do you agree? This stuff has to stop and it starts with US, that is you, and me."
53,"@repblumenauer In a ""Representative"" form of government it is your responsibility to represent ALL people in your district.  Do you represent my views, what about my voice, or do you have another agenda that keeps you running for office for 24 years to occupy a seat for progressives? Silence?"
54,"@repblumenauer WE want to see your tax returns Mr Blumenauer, before the election.  Any problem with that;  Silence means YES. thx."
55,"@Tribble_Bait @repblumenauer IS it 13 or 14 terms???  Maybe time for some new ideas but as long as Portland keeps electing him, they will get the same politics framed out of the 60s and 70s.  To long in one office opens doors to all kind of problems."
56,"@OregonGovBrown Kate you are a echo chamber for Pelosi, People read Pelosi's comments on twitter, there is an echo here.  Strange alliance between Brown, Pelosi, and Blumenauer.  What's the next shuffle? Brown senate, Bluem to Governor, Pelosi ???? up or out.??????"
57,"@repblumenauer People, READ HIS COMMENT CAREFULLY.  The ""Cronies""(interesting noun)  are to prevent rioting, not protesting.  Make no mistake, Earl enthus supported keeping Fed Help out.  Now he wants them to come in and clean up His n Wheeler's mess.  Sound hypocritical to me, how about you?"
58,"@MisikoMichael @nypost Michael, they respect presidents that put billions of dollars into the USA budget for foreign assistance.  No money their support goes away with it.  These are things that have been swept under the rug for too long."
59,@Primantibro1 @JCStarbuck3 @nypost Orrrr shining light on a terrible wrong.  Maybe
60,@SenJeffMerkley The point is that the rioters have mixed in with the protestors and destroyed property and killed one person.  You are deflecting from the fact you supported a failing mayor and endorsed taking out your Federal officers that could have stopped  this in a number of days
61,@SenJeffMerkley Things change Jeff.  This was from 2016 when democrat's wanted to put in justice before the presidential turn over.  This post is misleading to people.  How can we trust you on other things to tell the truth.???  Again How?  But I am sure you are to busy to reply.  Stay busy Jeff

I don't think I am the brightest but that doesn't seem to be a prerequisite for running for congress!!  Why do you think a curfew would be ineffective?  do you have another idea to stop this?"
64,@SenJeffMerkley Can you get Wheeler to do a curfew?  https://t.co/B4qtvFxcWe
65,@fox12oregon Curfew anyone?  https://t.co/B4qtvFxcWe
66,"@repblumenauer Do you think you can talk Mayor Wheeler into a curfew until this cools off, like tonight??
https://t.co/B4qtvFxcWe"
67,@JoAnnPDX I emailed you about a curfew last week.  It is working in Minneapolis Minn  Second Night Of Curfew Expires In Minneapolis; Nearly 50 Arrested   YOUAL NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW.

87,@repblumenauer Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 put $5.5 billion payment onto USPS.   Can't you suspend the payments?  Permanently or temporarily?  I think this one deserves an direct answer.
88,@repblumenauer Talked to Portland postal worker on his route yesterday.  He said he is not noticing issues.  Management is because of PERS allocations. $5bil yr.   He said one of his coworkers delivered 220 votes to an empty house during primary. Isn't this open doors for fraud?
89,"@repblumenauer This is the ""REALITY"" of a City (Portland Oregon) and State run by progressive politicians.  IS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT FOR AMERICAN AND OREGON going forward? https://t.co/QY23iFuqXe"
90,"@repblumenauer Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 requires Post Office to pay additional $5.5billon a year to fund retirements. PO was in black until then, I remember when they did it. Also Amazon requires delivery on Sunday for $1 a box.  Focus on these, Earl passed it 2006!!!"
91,@repblumenauer And many more MILLIONS who are for a vote-at-polls election
92,"@repblumenauer You are hearing, let the election go on as normal, stop this voting drama, enough going on with the BLM, Antifa, city burn(Which you supported)  Hard to believe someone in America would vote for someone with your bias and socialist agendas.  PEOPLE, STOP AND THINK A MIN."
93,"@repblumenauer Vote at the polls, use the voting machines built to stop fraud, use your head and stop following this, mail in voting has MANY ways to manipulate. We saw some of it in our primary in May in Oregon."
94,"@repblumenauer everyone that follows this tweet, National elections have never been by mail voting machines were created to stop fraud, THERE IS NOTHING CONSTITUTIONALLY ILLEGAL HAPPENING HERE.  This is devisive, irresponsible  THIS IS YOUR US HOUSE REP, WOW NEED CHANGE HERE do not support this"
95,"@billbailoutbill @gonzospromos @FromKalen How's that.  The police were told to stand down, right?"
96,"@SenJeffMerkley What if we want to go to the polls to vote?  Still want to shove mail in ballots down the people's throat?  You are nothing but a clanging symbol for the Dem party line.  You have lost your critical thinking they call it ""Sold out""  Can we please get someone else in this office ?"
97,"@SenJeffMerkley Jeff Jeff Jeff, he is wanting a normal election so the mail in ballots can not be manipulated.  You are the one ""Fighting"" for something abnormal.  Remember pointing fingers at someone there are 4 fingers pointing back at you.  Please quit deceiving people or Oregon. Party line."
98,"@SenJeffMerkley I have PPE, give me a PO"
99,"@SenJeffMerkley @senatemajldr Jeff, I can get you all the PPE you need.  Give me a PO......unless this post is just political BS.  I have PPE Jeff, masks, antibody test kits, clothing, anything you need.  PO?  This post dated 8/16/20  Let's see if you even respond.???"
