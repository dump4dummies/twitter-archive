1,"Yes, I think we are all in agreement here. But you could’ve had the courage to come up and talk to us instead of leaving this on a volunteer's car while door-knocking. #rocaforcongress https://t.co/FsMwIF3P0x"

8,@ConservativeTX_ Thank you for including me! 🇺🇸🙏
9,"Thank you so much for including me among the Conservative Latinas running for office who are trying to save our country! 

The Republican Party is the party of Faith, Family, Freedom, and Hard Work! https://t.co/n3FeFdz5JY"
10,"Critical Race Theory is racist. Teaching children to hate themselves and each other is wrong. Replacing real American history with radical, woke left wing ideology is abhorrent.

CRT does NOT belong in our classrooms, no matter what it's called, or how it's disguised."
11,The single biggest driver of inflation right now is the Democrat Party.
12,@TeAlligood sadly this is true
13,"@groon3r @alexstein99 not sure, perhaps he knows I'm a big fan of the Texas City Council Rap subgenre. also two people on the Roca For Congress team are cat maximalists as well, who knows?"
14,"@USMCatFan who would you rather go pheasant hunting with, joe or kamala?"
15,"@GaryGnu66274907 it's true, cornpop was there and can vouch for everything"
16,"@Beautyjunkie21 i hope not, but who knows what the people really in charge are up to"
17,@CurtisWalkerMD the panel will probably find the bike was built by structural racism. millions of dollars in investigations needed.
18,@AbuMoha37425312 agreed! and voters need to be extra cautious of Democrats in 2022.
19,"@TeAlligood the bike was sunsetting, joe on the other hand remains of perfect mind and stamina according to cnn"
20,"Happy Father’s Day to all the Dad’s out there! The ones who step up to take care of their kids no matter what. The ones that help Mom, because they want to not because they feel forced to. Today is your day, and we celebrate you! 

#rocaforcongress #fathersday #dad #fatherhood https://t.co/uUw0kZRYwF"
21,Why in the world would they even let Joe on a bike in the first place?
22,"@townhallcom It's almost as if pro-criminal policies and anti-police rhetoric have consequences. Chesa's gone, now get this guy out next"
23,"@freedomrings22 @w_6079 @USATRUMPMAN1 exactly this, this is what they've always done"
24,"@RSLC ""CBP had nearly 12,000 people in custody on any given day but ousted less than half of the illegal immigrants it encountered. The rest were either released outright at the border or transferred to other agencies, most of which would release them.""

Mayorkas needs to be impeached!"
25,"Imagine how much worse it would be if they'd been able to pass BUILD BACK BROKE?

Democrats' far-left policies seem perfectly designed to destroy the middle class. We can't afford more of this. RED WAVE INCOMING NOV 2022, VOTE ROCA JULY 19TH SO WE CAN WIN IN MD-06! https://t.co/1VAo5w1Buo"
26,"@AbuMoha37425312 @YouTube They can't win on the issues, so the left and big tech stifle speech and DEBATE. In this case, quite literally."
27,"WH Climate Advisor @ginamccarthy46 wants Big Tech to censor critics of Green New Deal style energy policies. In the name of ""public health,"" ofc. @YouTube took the GOP 6th District Primary DEBATE down for ""misinformation."" Paying attention? VOTE ROCA 7/19

https://t.co/CztJO5XcrI"
28,"Looks like @YouTube strikes again. We uploaded the MD-06 candidate forum video from May 16 to our channel and it was taken down for “misinformation”. They can take our content down all they want, but this red wave is still coming. 🇺🇸 #rocaforcongress #MD06 https://t.co/62qcWmUl9N"
29,"Couldn't have said it any better @MayraFlores2022 

Dems pander to Hispanics while using far left university newspeak like Latinx (that we resent btw).

Dems endanger everyone coast to coast, from the Rio Grande to Hagerstown, MD with destructive open border policies. https://t.co/9WFLpU8pfp"
30,@TeAlligood @MayraFlores2022 Certainly do! Go @MayraFlores2022!
31,@TeAlligood The goal of all far left movements is the destruction of the middle class. None of this happening by accident. This isn't your grandpa's Democratic Party! #WalkAway
32,"Yes, Joe Biden and Dems - definitely changing lives!

Changing the value of our savings with sky high inflation.
Changing the amount we spend on gas.
Changing our national sovereignty with wide open borders.
Changing our children with radical gender and racist indoctrination. https://t.co/ZBYfwDRWpN"

I’m the only candidate in MD-06 that checks all of these boxes! Help MD make history as well! @TonyGonzales4TX https://t.co/Pd3ki9Dfrh"

37,"My volunteers are doorknocking in Cumberland today, they’ve spoken with a lot of retirees on a fixed income. With inflation rising, their lifetime’s hard work is netting them less and less. Does Ron Klain (Biden’s Chief of Staff) still think inflation is a “high class” problem? https://t.co/YqqjQFwy76"
38,"I must have missed the memo. Note to self, never use @eventbrite again. Can't even use this to track attendance for an event. Have been spammed with over 200 fake registrations in the last two days. 😡

46,"We all know the Biden Administration will embrace these illegal aliens with open arms. “Remember who let you in, and vote Democrat!” they say. 

A vote for me on July 19th is a vote for securing the border, and the livelihoods of everyday Marylanders! 🇺🇸 

https://t.co/ZhiCPhAi03"
47,"@TeAlligood @RepDavidTrone Exactly, and he's actively allowing unprecedented numbers of Marylanders to die in his district every year for this reason."
48,@iSeeWokePeople @RepDavidTrone I will always fight for border security as it’s in the people of Maryland’s best interest!
49,"The opioid epidemic is an emergency for all of Maryland, but especially the 6th district! @RepDavidTrone has voted against every measure to fund a wall. Securing our southern border is non-negotiable for OUR DISTRICT. I will vote for border security every time 🇺🇸 https://t.co/Z0RdxnFvdH"
50,@PeteMitchell65 @PIGSBBQ 🤘
51,"@TeAlligood @RepDavidTrone Well one of Trone’s main issues is fighting the opioid epidemic. Maybe he’s given one obvious solution at least *some* thought? I think the answer is sadly, no."
52,"Fentanyl is a deadly and growing problem here in Maryland’s 6th district. We need to take steps to address this tragedy immediately - #1 - securing our southern border so deadly drugs stop funneling into our country at unprecedented rates. 
 
What do you think @RepDavidTrone  🤔 https://t.co/QxM8i2SOX5"

61,Eyes are starting to come to the 6th district in Maryland! 👀 https://t.co/iM2GwhmuAO
62,Keeping our children safe shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It’s something ALL parents can agree on. Supporting our law enforcement is one easy way to keep them safer. Montgomery County has been debating SRO’s in schools for a while - what do you think?  https://t.co/n6IB4hyH4j
63,"As we spend time with our families this Memorial Day let’s not forget the military servicemen and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for this country. Today we remember and honor our heroes who fought and died for our freedom. 🇺🇸
