1,"So. Here’s the big question.

Those guys who never blow the big plays, but still insist that the game is legit and none of their teammates are compromised… at what point do you stop accepting them as legitimate representatives?"
2,"Eventually, this becomes obvious and people stop watching. So the owners occasionally rotate those players with new ones.

The other players on the team as well as the other team insist that no one is blowing plays. No matter how obvious.
…"
3,"When the game is on the line, a core group of players on the losing team can always be counted on to blow a play that gives the game back to the winning team.

This could be a blown coverage or bad throw that is intercepted…"
4,"A sports analogy for those that don’t understand the establishment GOP.

You have two football teams.
They only ever play each other.

One always wins. Always. There are times when the other scores and even leads, but never wins. (Contd)"
5,"The Dems put on show trials, throw GOP activists in jail, and economically attack others.

The GOP can’t even be bothered to call out Dems support for replacement migration or their support for kid drag shows"

Wearing sexy miniskirts,
And being self-reliant. https://t.co/V3vjB2tFsk"
11,"He’s talking about silencing political speech based upon the ethnic makeup of the speakers and their opinion on a topic. No one will be censored for supporting replacement levels, only for opposing it. https://t.co/WgjDNtPZwO"
12,"If you are upset about gas prices, wait till you see how much it costs to cool your house this summer in Houston suburbs"
13,Never forget that mourning your victims or asking for levels heads against your aggressors is considered hatred while they openly legitimize violence from them and make criminals into victims https://t.co/GslNxqhYPh
14,You know what would be nice? If Texas reps would work on fixing our problems instead of pointing out how bad things are in Chicago and other liberal hellholes.
15,@VDAREJamesK Is rule based upon God’s will sustainable when God’s will is not known to us? Can someone truly claim to be chosen by God to rule?
16,A good read - many GOP reps have this same issue of not living with the consequences of their treason https://t.co/znG9S3g5UB
17,What decade is the tweet from? 80’s? 90’s? 00’s? 10’s? teen’s? All true. All unfulfilled promises. https://t.co/TEXvjoNBCL

20,@Timcast The gop can’t even arrest illegal aliens and you’re claiming that they’re gonna arrest politicians?
21,"We know who and what they are coming for, we just don’t know who “they” are? https://t.co/mnhipxTi2G"
22,"It seems like there’s an extraordinary amount of drama within right wing circles. Many good men wanting to save this nation that are repeatedly disillusioned with bad faith actors. 

We have to end censorship and persecution of right wing views in this nation"

34,"A Democrat is someone who will create a false story of rape in an attempt to deny a qualified man from becoming a judge.

A Republican is someone who won’t put up sufficient fight to stop someone who can’t define what a woman is."
35,"Why does conservatism fail? It fails because the @gop elected officials are not actually conservatives.

This doc will clearly show that gop congressmen lie about their views and team with the media to keep out legit conservatives 

https://t.co/VYsyfJFNDE"
36,@MQSullivan Bout 90% sure we’re already being invaded and the Democrats are promoting it and the GOP is denying that it is happening
37,@CaryCheshireTX He is doing something about it. He’s telling the prols that he’s against. This protects his polling numbers.
38,"They want our young girls to be made into prostitutes, our young men made into women, and those that refuse this to fight in wars for other nations and return home and give their nation to foreign peoples.

The other party wants the same, but legally and at a slower pace"
39,"@TrueTXProject I participate in a number of tech / emerging tech forums with NASA. It is astounding how much of that time is spent telling me that we need fewer people like me.

The stories that I could tell..."
40,"these are all things that hurt workers and benefit the mega corps. 

Go against any of these and they will come at you with the same methods and with the same veracity as Russia - and yet they rarely if ever go after a Congressman in either party in that way."
41,"Open borders for cheap labor, ending of worker's rights and protections on labor, manipulation of the currency to transfer wealth from people to corporations and banks, and the ownership of land/housing by foreign nations and mega corporations ..."
42,"3. The conclusion from 1 &amp; 2 is that since these tactics are being used against dissidents in the west and not the western governments, those governments are either complicit with the goals of those mega corporations or are already conquered.
..."
43,"2. The tactics being used against Russia are the removal of the ability to conduct commerce and a blackout / demonization of all people/nations not fully on board. These are the same tactics used against dissidents in America, Europe, and Australia.

..."
44,"What became obvious with Russia / Ukraine.

1. International mega corporations have both the ability and the willingness to engage in economic warfare with a nation as large as Russia.

45,@TrueTXProject The plan is to get through the elections and then do nothing until you have to stall in the next elections
46,Not a single “conservative” within the gop will oppose this. They’ll justify the slow roll of removing constitutional rights of racists and then just do nothing as we all burn. https://t.co/cFUhNgTta3

49,"@BritishWeird ""your monuments were not destroyed by a foreign power, hell bent on destroying your country and your people""

I'd go back and look into that a little more"
50,"@Anastas45410660 No one doubts that, but there were multiple news stories about a single monument. - which wasn't even actually touched."
51,"I am to believe that Russia destroying a single memorial in Ukraine is a terrible thing, but the mass destruction of memorials in the US and the continual, escalating demonization of the people whose history that they represent is noble and good?"
52,It’s almost like every policy and statement is centered around demonizing White people and Dems and Repubs only differ on WHY they are evil. https://t.co/dnyq5tLplc
53,@KennethRWebster Plus Kenny G made it even worse
54,"We’ve once again answered the question of “aren’t Republicans afraid of getting voted out of office if they go against @GOP principles?”

The media supports the establishment and refuses to do anything to help legitimate candidates and the left floods money into GOP elections"
55,"Anyone else notice that the same things being done to Russia (cutting off credit cards, shutting down apply pay, etc) are the same things done to Americans who disagree with tyranny here in the US?

One is intended to be an act of war."
56,@GregAbbott_TX We elected a governor years ago that ran on stopping this. His name was Abbott and he’s let in millions and charges Texas taxpayers for their housing and education.
57,"@GregAbbott_TX Fun facts. You can illegally employ foreign nationals in Texas with literally zero fear of punishment. If you go to the Texas border to stop people from invading, you get arrested"
58,@GregAbbott_TX Tough talk. Walk across Texas’a border and you get a tax payer ride anywhere in the nation.
59,"Funny how many @GOP reps use the term “invasion” when referencing the southern border and then go on about their business for literally decades while doing nothing.

Yet, an “invasion” of Ukraine requires military response? 

Are we being invaded or not? 
Why different responses?"

61,"The sole determining factor in whether a western government embraces a protest or imprisons the participants is the demographics of those protesting.

65,"Here's a @TexasGOP @GOP candidate for Galveston County party chair telling Americans that they need to shut up and listen to immigrants.

This is what the establishment party is - the Democratic party at the speed limit. https://t.co/1XuO0jsqdO"
66,@lakeboating2021 I think that you read that wrong. Dems changed their tunes when they saw the election projections and the GOP reps will change theirs as well when they start losing primaries.
67,"Just like the cure for Covid seems to be a midterm election, the ""authority"" to address the immigration invasion, CRT, spending, health care, education, AA, etc will suddenly be found when we hold GOP reps accountable in elections."
68,"@charliekirk11 Yes. In Canada, the government will destroy you financially. In America, we just put you on a no-fly list, seize your accounts, and then let multi-national corporations destroy. 

It's like free enterprise tyranny outsourced to foreign nations."
69,"In Canada, they pass laws to prohibit financial transactions of those supporting the trucker protests. Event selling their own houses.
In America, we instead use private, multi-national companies that financially ruin you, punish those that employ you, and ruin your life."
70,@MQSullivan The GOP will possibly lose statewide elections by 2026 and by 2030 Texas is a blue state.
71,@Beauloney1 @MQSullivan You literally cannot gerrymander a state.
72,"@MQSullivan Nowadays, they don't do ""endorsements"" because they know that it turns off conservatives. Today, ""reporters"" do puff pieces on Rino Reps that paint them as ""conservatives"" while writing articles about how anyone who actually wants to close the border is a White supremacist."
73,You're all passing this clip around and making fun of her. The reality is that she is allowed to speak this insanity while anyone who defends the native population of the nation is yelled out of the building. https://t.co/o2eYxoBynY
74,"If @GOP elected officials were working as hard for free speech and conservative values as they claim to be, the media would be attacking them, instead of an MMA / comedian / podcaster who talks about fun stuff."
75,"@heyjuliesue @_TipoftheSpear_ @TrueTXProject Unfortunately, I don't know much about Ft Bend. I will ask around and see if anyone locally knows anything."
76,"Biden should not be in a position to do this. If the @gop had built the wall like they were mandated or enforced immigration law at some point, we would not be in this position. https://t.co/z2MuApA8eI"
77,"@njbritton I ran in 2020 and unfortunately developed a severe health issue early on. I block walked a lot instead of raising funds and got 15% on $15,000. I plan on running again in 2024 with funding. I'll be putting out some videos soon."
78,@njbritton My polling shows a pretty steady 100%.
79,@njbritton I would agree that the amount of polling that a candidate does is a pretty good indicator of whether or not they actually believe what they are saying.
80,"@njbritton “I’d rather have my borders open, my money be worthless, and my children be discriminated against than support a candidate that doesn’t use language that I believe consultants would force them to use.”"
81,"many GOP constituents insist that ""their congressman"" is doing a ""good job"". Have you ever wondered why that is? I'll be putting out a video addressing this is a few weeks and a short excerpt will be available in days."
82,"- the GOP did nothing to stop masks and mandates
- the GOP does nothing to protect speech
- the GOP has done nothing to address health care
- the GOP has done nothing to address education
... and yet..."
83,"Every single person in the Republican party agrees that :
- the GOP didn't close the border (although Trump tried)
- the GOP isn't enforcing immigration laws
- the GOP has done nothing to stop CRT
- the GOP has done nothing to stop inflationary spending
..."
84,"Republicans : We don't have explicit funding for the wall or for enforcing laws, so we can't do that.

Democrats : We're gonna fly illegal aliens anywhere they want to go within the US and then fund crack pipes with taxpayer dollars.

(Republicans slink away)"
85,@MQSullivan @lukemaciastx @HillaryClinton @EvaGuzmanForAG It’s because Republicans have been duped into the idea that there are “acceptable” candidates and “extremists”. The media decides who is who.

91,@WrumpTon @GregAbbott_TX Houston has the highest number of murders - not murder rate.
92,@GregAbbott_TX Houston literally has the highest number of murders in the nation. Illegal employment is so rampant that no one even tries to stop it any more.
93,@MQSullivan The most shocking thing about that is how old Joe Rogan is.
94,Freedom of speech is a foundational principle of this nation. To say that it leads to violence is to say that it is not a right. Shameful for a Republican congressman to share such an opinion. https://t.co/H5N2ASEhce

We should be better than that"
98,"The pattern is simple.
Dems move policy drastically to the left.
People clamor to be saved and vote Republican.
Republicans promised nothing and do less.
People get apathetic/hopeless and stop voting as nothing changes.
Dems are then able to get elected.
Rinse
Repeat"
99,"@Texan1283 @GregAbbott_TX @DanCrenshawTX @chiproytx @tedcruz Even Cruz made the mistake of calling the J6 people ""terrorists"" when I really don't think that he views them in that manner."
