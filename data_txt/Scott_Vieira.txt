10,"@unlucko @RepMarkGreen @Kiran4Congress I understand that! If that is your choice, I respect that! I just believe it's time society breaks itself away from the two party system, as it has made it less about US, and more about THEM and their power and control!

Just keep that in"

I am one of those individuals!"

And while you're at it, stop giving the wall such support, as it does basically nothing, while the Border Patrol actually work their ass off.

18,"@RepMarkGreen It's not just the wall providing....Border Patrol Agents and their ability to do their duty is a much more major factor at this point. The only reason I even care about the wall is because the majority of Border Patrol support it and believe it would help them

Quit pandering 1/2"
19,"@unlucko @RepMarkGreen @Kiran4Congress While I believe you, you do realize that Democrats are no better, and only pretend to care, in order to get votes? Or are you corrupted by the two party system as well?"

30,"We must remain honest to ourselves and see the reality of the situations in front of us. 

The reality of the situation is that we currently have a Congress, filled with our elected officials, who are more worried about other things than what their job requires them to be worried"

36,"@yelphets @RepMarkGreen @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I am not sad, I'm very happy....nor am I filled with hate......any man who continues to ""sniff"" or touch a woman, who shows she is uncomfortable, including the children, and tries to pull away from the man, isn't ""affection"", it's disgusting and supporting that is too"
37,"@yelphets @RepMarkGreen @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Any man who ""shows affection"" by sniffing a little girl who is pulling away, is a pedophile....anyone who supports him is a pedophile...congrats on supporting the rape and sexual assault of children.......it shows a lot about yourself.....I feel sorry for any children you have"
