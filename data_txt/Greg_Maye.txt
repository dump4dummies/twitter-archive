12,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Letâ€™s take 1 at a time. What lies about Russia? Was the Trump campaign not in communication with them and lied about it to the FBI? Did some of the people lying   not get convicted in a court of law due to the overwhelming proof presented?
13,"@mike_angarone @velsun @OccupyDemocrats As I said, Mueller's report laid out 10+ instances of obstruction of justice with all of the elements needed to get a prosecution in court - gift wrapped; all the boxes checked- off. Probably too afraid of it being called political (by those who will always say that, a.k.a., GOP)"
14,@velsun @OccupyDemocrats Will we ever know what we should about Russia's work to install a US president &amp; who helped since Mueller's work was allowed to pass its statute of limitations? Why did Garland not prosecute the low-hanging fruit (10+ instances of obstrn) already investigated and delivered?
15,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Not only are you deflecting but making you're  making assumptions about something that I have not said one word about. As protests go, courts and the DOJ have said that it was not a legal protest so people are going to jail. No real need to debate or get you to agree with that."
16,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Sometimes its what we THINK we know that keeps us from learning.
17,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila I, in no way, am defending people who are profiting through corruption as a public servant. Where it can be proven it should be prosecuted. Law and order starting from the top down. The problem is you seem to assume it where there is no proof and deny it where there is proof."
18,"@princecaspian41 @Rodrigo7142000 @TheRickyDavila Why do you blame lockdowns and not a pandemic? Are you referring to reckless spending as the measures taken to mitigate damages that the pandemic helped create? If we drill down past the generalities, we might put our finger on specific issues that have solutions."
19,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila What sources? And why isn't the actual, formal hearing one of those sources? It has all the footage, explanations and sworn testimony. Why are you afraid of watching HOW are WHERE the information comes from?"
20,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Speaking of deflection, why have you drifted so far away from the crimes of Trump and the GOP without explaining why they are not crimes? Storming the Capitol. You said it was a protest, then deflected. A protest that attacked police and broke in to stop transfer of power?"
21,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila If you could really see projection and hypocrisy we wouldn't be having this discussion.
22,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila There're so many more. You're asking for a recap of over 4 years of crimes but you won't look at the detailed presentation when it is actually being given to you. Why are you doing it this way? Just watch the information as it comes out in a variety of normal, mainstream media."
23,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila 1) Planning to unlawfully overturn a legal election by means of fraud and the incident of violence 2) 10+ instances of obstruction of justice 3) working with foreign governments to try to get in and stay in office 4) campaign payment used as hush money to defraud voters 5) etc.
24,@BrycePh36127731 @Griffingirl711 @TheRickyDavila Maybe you think it was protesting and not a crime because you won't watch anything that shows you differently.  Physically attacking the police in an effort to break into the Capitol to stop the government from functioning is a crime whether you want to believe it or not.
25,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Whatever you believe your reasoning to be, ask yourself if that's merely justification? I assume you're not too lazy to watch. So what could it be that keeps you from wanting to hear the evidence for yourself? How do you know you disagree? Maybe you don't WANT to agree?"
26,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Lol. They MIGHT lock your account. I can honestly say that no one and nothing's perfect but there is a big difference between a diamond and a rock. You only seem to see the flaws in the diamond. Point to a crime of Pelosi and I'll give you 20 from Trump.

How convenient. But I don't think you can credibly say you're against corruption anymore."
30,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Could PRE-judging the hearing be a defense mechanism? Preventing you from discovering more evidence that you may have been mistaken about some things? We all make mistakes. It's more important to GET right than to start off that way. Only ego says differently.
31,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Why would you avoid seeing and hearing the presentation of evidence from the hearing and THEN judging its validity? Why is it essential that you PRE-judge?
32,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Why won't you say what your sources are? An example?
33,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Here's a term: willful blindness.
Apparently, Trump used this (as do many others) to ignore information/facts presented to him (like the election was fair) to be able to stick to what he'd already decided he wanted the truth to be. Not watching the hearings, huh?"
34,"@BrycePh36127731 @Griffingirl711 @TheRickyDavila Sounds like your great leader has convinced you that the purpose of everything on TV is to be graded by its entertainment value. Too bad information is not important to you. BTW, how are you forming such strong opinions with no info.?"
35,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila I am all for strengthening laws and improving the professional, consistent enforcement of those laws, starting from the top down. Corrupt politicians can do so much more harm than the average, small-time criminal.  But when Trump and friends are accused, you won't watch? Theatre?"

Did you ever ask Trump for a pardon?â€¦"
40,"@BrycePh36127731 @Griffingirl711 @TheRickyDavila Didn't hear Biden say that, but Trump went out of his way to call it the ""China Virus"". Obviously, to deflect from his poor handling of the crisis &amp; his prediction that it would just go away - encouraging people to be angry at the Chinese instead."
41,"@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila He didn't BAN travel from China, he restricted it. Lots of Chinese &amp; returning Americans still came in. Shutting down businesses is not what I said. He lied about the severity &amp; mislead people into being more careless causing more deaths &amp; exacerbating the economic problems."
42,@Griffingirl711 @JasonWSchaver @TheRickyDavila You seem to have a blind spot. A bias of which you are unaware. You have an exaggerated perception of one side's wrong-doings while ignoring glaringly obvious and provable wrong-doings of a much larger scale by the other. Is that possible? I always check myself for that. You?
43,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila And it's not that both are equally bad. Which side gave us Citizens United? Votes against campaign finance reform? Relies heavily on donations from the NRA? Gave us a SCOTUS who ignores ethics violations all other judges adhere to? Has exponentially more convictions for crimes?
44,"@Griffingirl711 @Rodrigo7142000 @TheRickyDavila Your perspective is unique to Fox, Newsmax, Breitbart, etc. Right-wing echo chambers. You appear to not know what is considered proven fact, not just in the rest of our country's news media but the world's news media. You repeat Russian propaganda seemingly without realizing it."
45,"@Griffingirl711 @sexytori17 @LiliSophia @RepAndyBiggsAZ Repeatedly. Like many other things, aspects may be interpreted differently and should be debated publicly. Starting with accurate wording   instead of paraphrasing."
46,@Griffingirl711 @BrycePh36127731 @TheRickyDavila Yes. I think most of us really do believe in many of the same things but may not define or express things the same way. If we first searched for similarities &amp; built from there we would be more productive and civil to one another. When we break into tribes we restrict ourselves.
47,"@Griffingirl711 @sexytori17 @LiliSophia @RepAndyBiggsAZ If the election results gave you that outcome and after the most exhaustive recounts and litigation ever, nothing was found that proved differently, are election results only valid now if the loser says they are? Is that the burden of proof for all elections, now? One's beliefs?"
48,@Griffingirl711 @Rodrigo7142000 @TheRickyDavila I realized you didn't answer this. You just switched to talk about Hillary and she's not even running for office. Russian/Trump alliance in 2016 election disproven?? Did you see the footage and hear the call?
49,@Griffingirl711 @Rodrigo7142000 @TheRickyDavila And here's the thing: if we had anywhere NEAR the amount of evidence on Hillary as we have on Trump I would say she should be held to account the same way. Can you say that in reverse?
50,@Griffingirl711 @Rodrigo7142000 @TheRickyDavila Eeeevvidddennce please. Or even something that the rest of us have even heard of enough to comment. Anybody can make unsubstantiated claims.

65,"@Griffingirl711 @sexytori17 @LiliSophia @RepAndyBiggsAZ You're simply making claims w/ no supporting evidence. Just because 45 was rude and broke all the rules, that didn't make him tough.
