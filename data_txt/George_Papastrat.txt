1,One of the NC reps who don’t support medical cannabis. His contact info is on my post. Please let him know how we feel. ⁦@Barbara4NC⁩ lead from the front. It’d about rights not affiliation.   https://t.co/TN5v4Dwirj
2,NC assemblymen George Cleveland and Phil Shepard stated they are against medical cannabis yet represent the largest base on our coast. Guess we are just pawns Funny how communist that sounds. Not voting for what the people want. @NCGOP @NC_NORML @CannabisNow01
3,NC assembly is voting down a cannabis bill because our representatives don’t represent. @Barbara4NC  good luck I got your back my @GOP brothers in @NCGOP don’t know how to represent. Vote for rights not for the party!

8,The biggest disappointment of the campaign is realizing how far from good we have became. I’ll never stop. #seewhathappens
9,@keith_caughran The biggest takeaway from running for office is knowing there really are bad people in office and who pay the funding for idiots. It’s so sad as a veteran to realize that.
10,The quality of politicians in the US downfalls daily.

56,@Sechman @NC_NORML @HighClassCarrie @CannabisNews @WRAL Pretty sure George Cleveland can’t use a computer. He is old enough to be my kids great grandparent and has no sense of what society wants or needs. I’m voting for Ike Johnson. The D running against him. And I’ll make that statement public. He supports me Cleveland doesn’t
57,@Sechman @NC_NORML @HighClassCarrie @CannabisNews @WRAL I’m. It a party line voter🤪 but your statement about NC not caring about vets is correct. The old timers see it as $ and resource or team member. Problem is D wants to take guns and be a socialist society. There has to be give and take. It’s why it works. We forgot the give part
58,@Sechman @NC_NORML @HighClassCarrie @CannabisNews @WRAL What’s sad is I was a good pawn and did what it was told for a long time in the desire of getting back what input into our country. Our kids are screwed lol

61,@keith_caughran @NC_NORML @HighClassCarrie @CannabisNews @WRAL I have no faith @NC_NORML   I just ran for a federal office and not so much as a phone call of need anything or good luck.

64,A letter from my mother to @NCGOP @Barbara4NC @RepGregMurphy @NC_NORML @cheyennepagantv @WhatleyNCGOP how about we fix ourselves in NC. Vote senate bill 711 asap medical cannabis saves lives. Do the right thing. https://t.co/Lc2jTqrMKU

66,@JustJennKat1 @NCGOP @CannabisNews Same story here 🇺🇸
67,And I’m a Republican lol
68,@cannabisinfuse @NCGOP @CannabisNews Hopefully so. If not I’m moving lol
69,The state of @NCGOP is so backward they would rather me take opioids other than medical cannabis. WTF?? Learn something @CannabisNews #Veterans #worktogether
70,@Sechman Yep. But I have faith. I retired from the military base here. It’d important to me. And those that come after me. It’s our responsibility to make it better for the future generations. I’m not stopping 🇺🇸

74,@cannabisinfuse But I’m not stopping till it’s decriminalized and available to everyone who wants it.
75,@cannabisinfuse Bro I just ran for a us house seat on that platform lol. Disabled veteran. Figured someone would listen I was wrong
76,@cannabisinfuse sounds like we have a similar past except I can’t have the meds I need in the backward state of NC
77,Thanks for the retweet
78,@researchmrx let’s #seewhathappens y’all
79,Told ya #seewhathappens. I won’t stop can’t stop never will. We went to war. We need help. We want medical #marijuana get with the program #nc #northcarolina https://t.co/SAj7t0pc2Y

81,@RedemptionBong I am quite loud and I email them regularly.
82,@Sechman Touché
83,@JacobJJacobs9 Can’t we agree but be different parties ?
84,@Sechman If we agree should party mean anything though ?
85,I tried to tell you to link up so we can work together. As a Republican pro cannabis veteran who just ran for the US House I’m a cannabis platform. Y’all need to harness the veterans from conservative areas of the state. https://t.co/y2ej4BuLfa
86,@EL44766671 @Barbara4NC @CheriBeasleyNC We shall see. I opened the doors on the younger R side of the house. I think the Ds I have spoke with also understand the purpose of partisan work. So hopefully we can make waves as a team and country not split
87,@EL44766671 @Acosta @RepGregMurphy @SenThomTillis @Barbara4NC I learned enough to make 2024 successful and that’s what counts. Also we need to remember #teamworkmakesthedreamwork

90,"Teamwork makes the dream work. #seewhathappens. @ Richlands, North Carolina https://t.co/qVnQb76Goq"
91,@HighClassCarrie @GOP @NCGOP I seriously am Thinking about trying to get the 5k signatures to be a independent on the ballot in 2024. The whole #democrat or #Republican i want to be friends with both lol
92,"The real question is if the @gop @NCGOP can’t get with the times should I switch to Independent and can you win a congressional race as a I. But man, they just can’t recruit the youth like I need them too"
93,https://t.co/dxW5KVwMR7. If you live in #NC call your state reps about this #420friendly bill. We need medical cannabis here. @CannabisNews @cheyennepagantv @wcti12 @NC_NORML @NCGOP do the right thing.
94,@EL44766671 @LeahaSla @JennyMcLarsonRN @Barbara4NC If everyone thought like that we would win as a country 🇺🇸
95,@EL44766671 @LeahaSla @JennyMcLarsonRN @Barbara4NC The dialog is now open 🇺🇸
96,@HighClassCarrie We’ll see with senate bill 711.
97,@HighClassCarrie The sad part is the research is done. Literally in 38 states. Shit there are states with a program. He who’s federal officials don’t vote yes. That does t even make sense.
98,"@keith_caughran Where was the 1.2 million people when I ran for office promoting it? Everyone says they are for it. No one stops up and does anything. The voice needs to be heard and fixed @NC_NORML ??#seewhathappens I’m not done, hopefully others start to help. Call legislators 🇺🇸@NCGOP #nc03"
99,So what’s the solution for those in chronic pain where we don’t have medical cannabis as a option? Get addicted or go on SSDI? Is that the agenda we are shooting for? Combat veterans need a win. #420friendly #stopthepills #seewhathappens #cannabis
