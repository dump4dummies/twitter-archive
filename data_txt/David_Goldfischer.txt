1,"First Trump unleashes a pandemic on America by calling it a hoax and stalling preparations; now he claims to care about public health. If you are seeking transparent consistency, consider his friend and patron Vladimir Putin, who has spent five years bombing Syrian hospitals. https://t.co/8VS4N6ytdr"
2,Trump now admits that the Republicans rely on suppressing votes. He may be ready next to admit that he welcomed and covered up Putin‚Äôs attack on America in 2016 and 2020 to ensure his victory. He senses we are ready to give up on democracy. Is he right? https://t.co/dSlQIC4par

But since Trump did this CONSTANTLY:

‚ÄîDOW across Obama Presidency:
7,949-19,732.  
Rise of 148%

‚ÄîDOW across Trump Presidency:
19,732-19,576 (as of right now).
Rise of ZERO.

You stood by him when he covered up Russia‚Äôs attack, called Nazis ‚Äòfine people‚Äô, and was caught cheating to win re-election.

24,Can pundits stop opining that Trump is too insecure to acknowledge Russian aggression on his behalf? Trump KNOWS that Putin again attacks the US to help him win. Trump KNOWS that  covering up the attacks is smothering our democracy. Fighting back starts with facing facts.
