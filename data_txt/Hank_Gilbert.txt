25,@cynthiasmu @Twitter Yeah it’s decidedly not funny!
26,@imanjonz This area isn’t a priority for the state dem party so their lawyers were not inclined to be too helpful.
27,"This is Upshur County’s Facebook page. Not one word, not a copy, nothing of the order extending voting times till 8 pm. They can’t even be bothered to update their social channels with a district judge’s order? https://t.co/HQA2FxkLSc"

40,Louie Gohmert hasn’t announced a substantial infrastructure investment in our district in nine years.
