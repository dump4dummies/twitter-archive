16,Thankfully the Pentagon is not in charge of delivering justice in this country but the idea that a gov. agency openly ignoring &amp; working against the actual law is hard to understand. This is clearly an act of treason in a rather unique set of circumstances &amp; cannot be allowed. https://t.co/cZOqOloQuj
17,Five years and a few months ago Norma McCorvey (Jane Doe) died after never having an abortion and spending much of her life advocating against abortions after being used as a political pawn in RoeVWade. She was arrested multiple times as a participate in anti-abortion protests.

29,"Our framers were not considering ""hunting"" when they wrote the 2nd Amendment. They were concerned about evil tyrants that would use force to control the American people. Our framers life-experience instructed their written provisions that continue to protect us today."
30,"Hunting was not specifically a 'thing' 250 years ago. Survival however has always been a thing and we did enjoy the use of traps, hand weapons, and eventually fire arms to put food on the table. The recreation/sport of hunting evolved from our needs into what it is today."
31,Great video from @RepBoebert! It is vital for us to realize that our 2A rights were chiefly pointed at our collective ability to protect ourselves from the potential for our own government to become tyrannical. The argument used for hunting is interesting because... https://t.co/2Jxo7Y39kx

62,Not only blame others but make threats to force the obvious need which you prevented. This is utterly unAmerican. But then tyrants are not known for their superior IQ. https://t.co/OWudnp6XPP
63,The worst part of the J6 commission is the propaganda nature which misleads and enflames ignorant people. This unjustly sews division in America at a time when many people are not capable of or willing to think critically about the effects of nation-dividing propaganda.

65,@TheCalvinCooli1 Trump knows the ropes &amp; has proven that he will defend Americans under pressure. DeSantis will learn even more &amp; put himself in a position to lead in 2028 &amp; beyond.
