68,"@hendershot_tom @JimInhofe @realDonaldTrump 1) Inhofe mentioned the need for firearms to hunt during pandemic.  This is unlikely considering the season.
2) If you need firearms for protection, then you should already have firearms and practice using them.

I'm not trying to weasel out of anything."
69,"@hendershot_tom @JimInhofe @realDonaldTrump If you are referring to my hunting season reference, it was a direct response to Inhofe saying firearms are essential for hunting during the pandemic.  It was not a statement about the second amendment."
