0,@McCainJack What’s the worst that can happen? https://t.co/AOaeS9vltV
1,@howellsuzy I won’t disagree
2,@amyjdean I don’t disagree. The alternative to her is even worse.
3,"I’m not a fan of Liz Cheney. Mostly because of her father and because her platform represents him and that era of good ol’ boy country club politics. That being said, I respect the hell out of her for standing up to her party &amp; to Trump. Should she lose, we’re all in trouble."
4,"Keep doing all the hard work you've been doing to move us forward. It's important &amp; it's appreciated. There's now more people who might want to join us knocking doors, making calls, writing post cards, etc...talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community. Teamwork &amp; Head up"
5,"I’m still most blown away knowing that instead of being locked up in a holding cell until testimony under oath regarding knowledge and roll in attempting to subvert a presidential election has been provided and investigated, a Supreme Court justice was able to overturn law."
6,@RexChapman I want this to be the newest tik tok video fad so we can enjoy watching people attempt to do this…
7,@McCainJack A sheared off chain link or two would be a great touch
8,"@NSetnan There’s a lot of people who voted for these people because of a letter next to the name, now regretting that decision. That’s who it applies to."
9,@McCainJack @cdrsalamander Let’s hope they have his discipline and training…
10,👀👀👀👀👀 https://t.co/E0Vl6eZ5GA
11,"“Let the states decide”… you know, like Arizona where the Governor and state legislature push through policies against the will and votes of the majority of Arizona voters regardless of political party… what’s the worst that can happen…"
12,She’s 100% correct. Man up men https://t.co/s4yRAl7Q85
13,@shelleyaw123 @WalshFreedom It’s also this yes
14,"If you don’t vote the aholes into office, you don’t have to protest…"
15,@atrupar What about his racism was ambiguous…?
16,@natsechobbyist The stupidity
17,@SenatorSinema come get your boy https://t.co/ol1wGAtTyl
18,@JohnCornyn Feeling free to finally be you aren’t ya John
19,"@mxPlzner @WalshFreedom I understand your doubt, frustration, and perspective. I travel all over the country and the world regularly. What unites us: family, survival, wanting better, love, music, laughter, fear, wanting better for our future…just a few examples. A convo we need to have with each other"
20,@RexChapman @Rainmaker1973 @emilyjodell Call in the airstrike now
21,"@WalshFreedom And be held to standards and accountability. Our current system is nothing more than a loophole for politicians to syphon tax payer money to family/donors in return for political access and support. As a parent I fully support “choice” - this ain’t choice, it’s politics via edu"
22,@WalshFreedom Joe I’ve been saying this for years: school “choice” isn’t between defunding public education and private/charters. It should be between fully funded public Ed (hi there constitutional mandate) and private/charters. Companies taking tax payer money should have oversight 1/2
23,"@WalshFreedom We are the United States of America. And other than politicians with their divisional agendas and the various forms of media profiting off of and pushing the division, the people of this nation are very similar. The states complaining about the fed tend to rely on it most."
24,@WalshFreedom Too bad
25,@WalshFreedom Joe… 🤦‍♂️
26,💯 https://t.co/gYAkLg3u8e
27,"Remember when JFK asked us to “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country…” Yeah, it’s time to ask what your country can do for you if healthcare,  violence, personal freedoms, and the law are no longer the priorities of action."
28,@btgozon Tell her I said hello and that I love her very much.
29,Never let them claim to be the party of small government again
30,100% this 👇👇👇 https://t.co/hG8vVoDpl6
31,And we let them off the hook https://t.co/0TF8ONp15s
32,This country is going backwards
33,"@McCainJack Im not a Porsche guy at all, but that vehicle is glorious and the commercial is excellent."
34,@BordleyStephen Saw that after the fact. Predictable.
35,@hazzard5 I see what you did there…
36,Manchin and Sinema need to sit today out.
37,Only thing missing today from the underground GOP scene is Paul Ryan announcing his presidential campaign.
38,@amv_anthony 100%
39,The good ol’ boys have gotten nearly everything they wanted out of Trump and they’re in process of disposing of him with their eye on taking back full power and control…
40,"@3dogrunner Well, there ya go."
41,Next they’re coming for who you can love. Take that to the bank.
42,@RinoLivesMatter But… also not full expensing…
43,Live feed from Mitch McConnells lair… https://t.co/Kdo7I9e5la
44,There's a big difference in officials/staff showing the courage to do what is right versus supporting who is doing wrong all the way up until it implicates them.
45,I didn't know whether to laugh or cry... well done @jordanklepper https://t.co/IWTnEQTsfi
46,@MeltdownWRIF Ninja Turtles live 1990s… epic
47,The former president didn’t just try to steal an election from his opponent or opposing political party. He tried to steal an election from all Americans. He’s tried to destroy the fabric of the greatest nation in world history. We must hold ALL accountable. No mercy for traitors
48,With the first pick…the @Suns select the reincarnation of Connie Hawkins en route to a championship!!!….
49,March them all out into the public square
50,@Garrett_Archer “Apoopriations committee”… I’ll show myself out 😂
51,"@Deeneeday I’ve been an independent most of my adult life and have requested primary ballots based on where I feel my vote will be most effective. It’s your call, but it’s a common strategy"
52,Pardon = Guilty AF
53,@bigbttmgurlphx @Lofoir Other than dissuading many from running and pushing away others who might have run for other positions after getting some prior experience under them and building up some name recognition…. Not sure.
54,It’s 2022 not 1776. That is all…
55,"@ArizLib More important is understanding that many of these uncontested areas have been uncontested for years. Running a senate and two house candidates can inject roughly $120k into an area that’s seen $0. If you want to change branding &amp; messaging, you have to compete. Helps up &amp; down"
56,@jnris4real @harrisonjaime I couldn’t tell you what he is doing (which may be part of the overall problem…) but my point is that he doesn’t run the state party. Other decision makers are behind that circus.
57,"@ChrisMurphyCT @SenatorSinema “Sure you wanted more, but without her you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to have gotten so little.”"
58,@wadetank The Arizona Clean election system is not available for federal candidates
59,@wadetank Federal elections financial reports are publicly posted here https://t.co/32Ip1womvs
60,@valerienunez Hi Val. Qualifying Signatures for candidates in most races were due in May I believe.  City council elections are still gathering signatures. Here’s a current link from the Arizona secretary of states office site https://t.co/sgOmTYWurq
61,@JDCocchiarella But you should see him play football against 6th graders...
62,@jnris4real @harrisonjaime He doesn't run the state party
63,"It's important to note the following:
The state of Arizona has a system called ""clean elections"". Candidates who can gather roughly 400 valid signatures and the same in $5 contributions, qualify for state funding for their campaigns (~ $40K free money) to use for their election."
64,"8 of 30 (27%) AZ state senate seats uncontested by Dems
21 of 60 (35%) AZ state house seats uncontested by Dems

Majority wins. Winners make policy.  

Dems must win 16 of 22 (73%) Senate races for majority
Dems must win 31 of 39 (80%) House races for majority"
65,@RinoLivesMatter Beautiful 72 here in Los Angeles
66,College baseball is awesome to watch. What a final inning!
67,@WalshFreedom Party is over rated. Just be yourself. Cheers to you and your bride buddy. Tell her I said hello and that I’m proud of her. Inspiring.
68,@Steve_Irvin 💯
69,@RepDLesko You seemed concerned about people coming to DC on Jan 6th. Weird.
70,Forget politics. This is what our future is about and who it is for https://t.co/DoeIdr6kE3
71,Democracy dies in the darkness https://t.co/i0GbLAxnJ7
72,@WalshFreedom Try being a Democrat
73,"If you want to be a patriot - serve your country, run for office, volunteer in your community, lift those who need help up. If you want change - be the change. There’s patriots all around us - teachers, LEO’s, healthcare workers, janitors, laborers, etc… Support them."
74,Congrats to everyone who has made it this far in our lives not trying to overthrow our own government. Apparently we’re all heroes and hey you can even still support those who tried and failed like the losers they are…
75,@stmorecowbell I’ll settle with both yours and mine combined.
76,@natsechobbyist @duty2warn Bowers just knew it would stick to him. He’s always been and still is 100% on board the Trump train
77,@RickGray The sky is blue…
78,@TTUCarter That and having their support to help his own success … 100%
79,@annmarie What a baby
80,@RedChevron Both sides do. Agreed.
81,@marcorubio Let us know when you expel yourself
82,@t_arnpreeest “Thou shalt gain thy power”… it’s in there somewhere I’m sure
83,Democrats need to stop taking Republicans bullsh*t. Full Stop.
84,@TTUCarter Because he’s full of it. Always has been.
85,@NoLieWithBTC Watch gas prices will go up to grab the additional $.18 savings
86,“Hero”… spare me please. https://t.co/xfZVoofg0T
87,@WalshFreedom They’re both old. And Trump is a traitor.
88,Defrauded ya darn auto correct!
89,"It shouldn’t be that big of a surprise that the same majority of Arizona law makers who’ve  defraud the people of Arizona for two years on election conspiracies, now somehow can’t pass a budget. Side note, it’s not like it’s going to reflect the interests of AZ voters anyway"
90,@McCainJack The ranch market is legit an Arizona staple
91,@RinoLivesMatter I mean… it’s Arizona…
92,"@Blubaycrab Neither have hundreds of democrats and democratic candidates. Including the ones running the hearing on both parties. Neither did hundreds of local officials, including the one who’s team actually ran the election in Az @Adrian_Fontes . Talk about not caving under pressure."
93,@Alex2287 I agree with recognizing him for showing integrity and upholding his oath of office. I simply don’t feel we should lower the bar of heroism to meet minimum standards of duty.
94,@Alex2287 He showed integrity. He did his job. It can be appreciated without calling the man a hero.
95,@MysterySolvent https://t.co/Hd2koR9TBy
96,@Lazy_Reporter @mtmama3skullz I can appreciate the use of Silver Surfer. Well done
97,@Lazy_Reporter @mtmama3skullz Don’t confuse me not appreciating him doing his job with my opinion that he isn’t a hero. I wish more people would do their jobs. The. The bar for politicians being a hero wouldn’t be as low as apparently doing their job…
98,@AzEagletarian @judy_heyjude3 Of course he was a compelling witness. And I’m happy he did his job. I disagree that he’s a hero.
99,Show us the Republicans giving back their fundraising money from election conspiracy bullsh*t … we’ll wait…
