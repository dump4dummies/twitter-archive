1,People don’t care that Trump tried to steal an election. It’s all about their feelings https://t.co/YHRc2BSaXM
2,She’s the farmer that brings nothing to the farmer’s market but takes the biggest subsidy check home to cash anyways. She’s got to pay the nanny to homeschool her kids that yours are all going to hell. https://t.co/PuSL6ewb2E
3,@Miller_Congress Well regulated. Don’t be part of the Small Body Bag Brigade.
4,"@Miller_Congress I bet this legislation will be a nightmare. What’s worse is blaming Dems for violence and then blaming them whenever they try and do something about that violence. If guns were the solution, we’d have less violence today after 2 of the top years for purchases of firearms."
5,"Has it really been 5 years already? Can it really be? Life has certainly changed, and so much really has fallen prey to inertia. https://t.co/mgdg8xBDMj"
6,"After decades of failed votes, failed policies, and failed politicians, it’s time for a fresh take. @anchor: https://t.co/2TETCxu3jD"
7,@smerconish  Words to live by: since I was a kid. “I’m constipated. I don’t give a shit.” That mantra led me through some of the most dark times in childhood and beyond.
8,"@RepMaryMiller When orders haven’t been full for the year, equip mfr will put it on hold until it is, helping to drive up the cost even further. Where were you when this was also a problem in 2021? On the border for a photo-op instead of actively working to solve problems for farmers, I bet."
9,"Since September 11th, we have lost over 40,000 of our soldiers and veterans who fought and lost their lives for each one of us, whether we supported war, conflict, or our national defense strategy, or lack thereof, at the time. https://t.co/koRpg2J0TT"
10,@flightnight9099 @GOP Of course people say the economy is bad with sustained inflation at this high of level. I know @RodneyDavis and @Miller_Congress haven’t done anything to help. Biden has consistently but not quickly enough. Fuel is high globally. So is inflation.
11,"@flightnight9099 @GOP There’s a reason your image doesn’t have any sources. #KeystoneXL was Canadian tarsands. Not good for gasoline. ANWR &amp; other protected lands wouldn’t reach market for years. And, Biden doubled no. of permits Trump issued. The industry has leases to use. https://t.co/Fo26FHeDOo"
12,"@GOP We remember the shambles Biden took over as Trump put his tail between his legs, skedaddled out of town. That wasn’t even two years ago. Maybe some Republicans will play like they have amnesia when they really remember all you offer are just the same politics as usual. We won’t."
13,@GOP Americans remember the lie of repeal and replace. How before and after you stood by and did nothing for any of us. Everybody remembers how you put tax cuts ahead of everyone and everything else. We remember you leaving the Great Recession behind.
14,"@GOP Americans are fed up with inflation, crime, and politicians who aren’t solving problems. What motivates voters to come out in November is going to be whatever party has lost the least trust and faith with them. The GOP didn’t even have a platform in 2020."
15,"We are more inclined to hide our brokenness to the detriment of both self and others. We won't stand for others pointing out our mistakenness, either. https://t.co/P3uyOO1p1m"
16,"@davidmweissman George Washington won a tug-o-war with Ben Franklin for the first AR-15, which is why it’s a protected right; and, the right to make decisions in your own body are only the government’s choice. That’s the Republican dream."
17,"@RepMaryMiller Again, just not backed up by what’s happening in our communities. Violence is going up everywhere. Why do you want to criminalize children? Is this the stick portion of your indoctrination program?"
18,"@Miller_Congress I know your brand of family values, Mary. No one had to attack the church because the church was too busy denying communion, enabling the harm of children, fostering a hostile environment to individuality increasing teen suicides, and forcing women and girls to do as ordered."
19,"@Jim_Jordan You should be ashamed of yourself for misleading people worse than the Dems on these issues. You didn’t read the #MuellerReport, you just politicized it like Republicans do everything. And, when all else fails, conjure fear in the Hillary monster. Godzilla needs Mothra back."
20,"When a Georgia Senate candidate recently mused out loud about evolution and apes, I knew it was going to be an interesting primary season. Especially when, despite being challenged by five other candidates, this Republican candidate elected to not attend https://t.co/Z1XqqItpq5"
21,"@GOP Wow, the Republicans are now the abracadabra party"
22,Too many know that service can lead to sacrifice. We shouldn’t be asking the National Guard to sacrifice anything else at all. They shouldn’t have to sacrifice anything in their college and university education. https://t.co/qY5DkHNfEA
23,"My interest in each of you is for a reason. I appreciate your interest in my life and what I do
May we find a better way forward than we have seen in any of the days that have come before us. https://t.co/zfTEgJYg5S"
24,@Jim_Jordan So observational. Not all that helpful to anyone that isn’t blind or already wishing they were after reading your Tweets for just a few beats. You would have shipped out the tainted baby formula and been bosom buddies with a war criminal to lower gas prices.
25,"The new Blue Ribbon district, as I call it because of how it is drawn, or CD13, might be more of a fight then Dems initially thought when they carved up all of the rest of Central and Southern Illinois to give Ds a +6 advantage. Looks like that edge evaporated. https://t.co/GjwhgihrkU"
26,"@GOP Remember, it was a split decision in 2020. Overwhelming support for Biden in popular vote &amp; electoral college. More people came out for Republicans in the gerrymandered districts across the country and in Senate seats. The country hates #Inflation. No shock there. Your solution?"
27,"@MarkMaxwellTV Let’s be clear, that Rabine case created a second class worker class in healthcare and other settings. I suppose all of these Republicans running for Governor want to have the General Assembly and Supreme Court call all the shots. How weak are they? Are they Rauner weak?"
28,RT @MarkMaxwellTV: Bailey again touts his suit against Pritzker’s Covid rules. Gary Rabine one-ups him and says while Bailey sued and won r…
29,"@MarkMaxwellTV The Irvin ad is as dishonest and disingenuous aa about everything on Bailey’s policy wish list : no more CRT, against Black lives mattering, likely why he demands no training for teachers on prejudice, racism, and bigotry; notice how he isn’t bringing up taxes due to his record"
30,"@MarkMaxwellTV No shock that Republicans don’t know the rules, don’t care to learn them either. That way they can lie more openly about it all without a lot of emotional baggage. Funny no one mentions mental or spiritual baggage."
31,"@MarkMaxwellTV No shock Bailey only gives lip service to law enforcement. No principles when it comes to honoring their sacrifices. 

Bailey has no shame; neither does Irvin though. Irvin’s own commercials are ridiculous about BLM/ALM, as are Bailey’s criticisms. Bailey wants it both ways."
32,"@MarkMaxwellTV What was this guy doing in preschool? Apparently, Sullivan wasn’t born as what he identifies as today. Or, he’s just trying to further isolate and create an even more hostile environment for LGBTQ+ children. Heaven help some child in his life that hears his toxic message."
33,"@MarkMaxwellTV Where is CRT happening, exactly? Why are Republicans afraid of ideas? Another example of @GOP #CancelCulture. They don’t understand it. They don’t care to understand either. That’s the Republican way. ‘Don’t Know. Don’t Care. Don’t Solve. Just Apply Fear.’"
34,"@MarkMaxwellTV The woke agenda? What is he even talking about? Or is it just buzz words of the @GOP #CancelCulture agenda? These fringe leaders all talk the same— lead the charge both for &amp; against eliminating &amp; silencing people. We need to be adding people in rural communities, not dividing."
35,"@PREPPYPINK711 @Miller_Congress It was actually a cop Graven solicited online back in 2003. Of course, he was using a state issued computer from his boss #Topinka when he did so. He also is no longer on the sex offender registry."
36,"Does she even know how formula is manufactured? There's a reason this used to be considered a pharmaceutical product. Does she know the conditions of these factories? 

Point to something that's going to actually help, not just yourself politically for a change. (3/3)"
37,"What does Mary Miller support here, exactly? She should be looking at what could be done right now to get more formula to moms, not blame Biden for something he did right. 

This is crap. And, how easy everyone falls for it. (2/3)"
38,"@GOP,@RepMaryMiller would have shipped out all that tainted baby formula. It killed 4 babies. 
What Biden did was protect all the children by shutting that crap factory down. That industry is a joke. They didn't do so well without regulations. Who could have guessed? (1/3) https://t.co/lJrSxzhtho"
39,"If you aren't paying attention to your local elected officials and what they are doing with millions of taxpayer dollars, you will want to start digging to find out what is going on in your own community. 
Drop me a line if you want to join the conversation! (3/3)"
40,"On one side, you meet James Di Naso, leader of Concerned Taxpayers of Coles County. He has been at county board meetings for 6 years. 

And, then, myself, noting the abysmal record as the board wants to silence any critics before they have time to reconsider.  (2/3)"
41,"Keep watch here for podcasts about Coles County Board's $3.1 million windows. Who thinks replacing windows with about a 1/3 of our ARPA funds is helping address any of our pandemic problems while inflation burns us nearly everywhere we turn? (1/3)

42,@davidmweissman We can bet Republicans will say it has absolutely nothing to do with guns and will make certain nothing changes while they run on the issue in the midterms. We can bet Dems get nothing passed and take all the blame. Typical day.
43,"Davis is simply trying to distract from his lack of results for his much longer tenure in Congress. He said he was for all of these principles. When it came to voting to support those principles, he couldn't do it because of who was in the White House. https://t.co/el5lKQfDTC"
44,"@MarkMaxwellTV By the looks of quotes in that article, Dems are running scared in their Blue Ribbon district drawn for a Democratic representative. That’s never a good look for party hacks to pile on a guy in a wheelchair trying to do something positive for his community and district."
45,RT @TinaSfon: President Biden on Wednesday will deliver a speech at a family farm in Kankakee to discuss the impact of Putin's invasion of…

50,"As long as Dems ignore rural America, erasing the filibuster is as dangerous if not more so than any action SCOTUS can hand down. Think about it. We’re one vote from @LeaderMcConnell controlling every committee. How can the future threat of the @GOP not be so obvious? https://t.co/RGJpeipMEW"
51,@JudiciaryGOP Still trying to find individual in the Second?
52,"The first 10 minutes of this podcast are as raw as they are jaw dropping . . .
It will leave you needing to hear the rest of the conversation.

https://t.co/7WDVrvltMx"
53,@Miller_Congress And lie under oath
54,"@RepMaryMiller Republicans think politicians should make decisions about your health. We all know abortions won’t end, instead becoming more dangerous for the poor. The wealthy and influential like Mary will still be able to buy their abortions wherever they can find them."
55,@IngrahamAngle What’s really an insult is to not change broken systems to protect today’s children from the same compounding interest BS just to placate people who should have been demanding reform decades ago but instead stayed silent because it was easier to follow the self-righteous herd.
56,"During board meetings that Weaver attended and never disclosed her potential conflicts of interest, she motioned and voted to not only bar the public from ever having access to the minutes of executive board meetings, she also motioned and voted to . . . https://t.co/QYGVTm31p2"
57,"@RepMaryMiller Rural American economy hasn’t been growing for decades, regardless of who is in the White House. What have you done? Not all that you could while in office. Meanwhile, Republican counties are spending millions of taxpayer money and no one is paying attention. Certainly not you."
58,"@RepMaryMiller Your policy outcomes limit and attack life, eliminating choice is your preference, you limit individual expression to your way, you stifle our unique American liberty, and seek to stop the pursuit of happiness for others you disagree with. Those are not American principles, Mary."
59,"@HouseGOP When Trump stole money Congress appropriated to fight terrorism to build his failed Wall, what did House Republicans do?"
60,"“We are taught to mask anything that is wrong with us, to adapt and overcome. Military culture looks at asking for help as a liability, from recruitment to training to the rest of one’s career.” https://t.co/sAN6g6Gzuq"
61,"@GOP This would land better if American taxpayers had not paid Trump family businesses for all of his trips to Mar-a-Lago. Trump made over $8 million off of us all, and you’re complaining about a trip to Delaware?"
62,@cspanwj @CharlieCookDC IL-15 has a hot GOP primary between @RodneyDavis &amp; @Miller_Congress but where Dems handpicked party-backed candidate isn’t even running any campaign. Dems raised millions off both GOP incumbents &amp; won’t put up any fight at all. Why won’t Dems fight for rural Americans?
63,@MarkMaxwellTV There will be a missing voice in the 2022 elections without you on that set. Always wanted you to embarrass me with some questions I wasn't prepared at all to answer. Another time.
64,"@RepMaryMiller @RepMTG I agree. MTG should be on the ballot. She doesn't remember anything important about the last few years of her life. All those people making stuff up about Biden's mental ability should count the number of times MTG said she couldn't recall, couldn't remember, or didn't know."
65,"@Miller_Congress What Trump proved was that all you needed was lip service. You didn't require results, just your big bailout to make up for Trump tariffs in the failed Trump Trade War. You didn't care about accountability, just that he attacked fellow Americans, even veterans."

71,"It's similar to a child touching a hot stove and burning themselves. You would think a person, at some point in their adult lives, would learn how to regulate their emotional responses to stimuli they should at least anticipate encountering daily. https://t.co/RLU6P4hDHJ"
72,@RepMaryMiller Nobody is encouraging children to get chemically castrated. Give us all a break with these histrionics. It's parents and their child that make these choices. Why do you even matter in that decision process? Why do you get to call the shots for anyone's identity but your own?
73,@RepMaryMiller I don’t see Americans horrified by inflation. I see them concerned and working on solutions. Like you should. You have a position to do something more about it yet choose to do nothing but tbis blame game political nonsense that only benefits yourself.
74,"@RepMaryMiller How would you know? You didn’t show up for the SOTU address and didn’t vote 5.7% of the time, one of the worst attendance records in Congress. I’ve seen every press conference. He talked about it in June 2021, before we had Delta and Omicron surges. You deny reality, though."
75,@RepMaryMiller What I see Biden doing is working on the problem. What are you doing about it? Just politicizing inflation? All you do is drive up the cost of political ad buys.
76,@Jim_Jordan You’re talking price controls. That’s lunacy.

80,"@RepMaryMiller Biden always has listened to farmers. Have you? Democrats always listen to farmers. Probably why every Democratic representative voted for HR5609, Cattle Contract Library. 13 Republicans voted against it. Funny how that works, Mary. Dems vote with farmers and consumers."
81,"@RepMaryMiller You’ve never voted for appropriations for anything. You’re not for funding the police, fixing our broken immigration systems, and people have been fearmongering about ‘coming for your guns’ since before we both were born. It isn’t happening. Come on. Do something for people!"

83,"@GOP Biden unleashed the American economic engine after it was smothered by Trump’s mismanagement. Now, many factors are driving inflation and migration. Instead of working to solve longstanding problems, the GOP is doing all it knows how to well: demonize and obstruct."

86,"@cspanwj @RepMcClintock This guy has the ‘do nothing different’ mantra down despite it never fixing any immigration problems. Wages increased last year, not before COVID19. Poverty decreased because of increased govt payments to more people because of the pandemic."
87,@cspanwj Over 50 American oil &amp; gas companies shuttered during Trump’s administration. Trump’s tax cuts made their foreign investments tax free. He failed on energy.
88,"@EccMassive @vikram_Singh002 @davidhogg111 Sounds like you float around depending on your mood. Patience is vital in conflicts like Ukraine. It's brutal for them. Having patience while Putin fails and Europe cuts their ties takes time and vigilance, not weakneed exasperation with no foundation, nor principle."
89,"@vikram_Singh002 @EccMassive @davidhogg111 The Abraham Accords are a nice start. It's basically 6 countries signing a friendly document. Not sure if it's the big deal Trump has made it to be. Regarding QUAD, what progress did Trump make there besides talk about it? Seems Biden is doing the heavy lifting . . . again."
90,@Miller_Congress They should relax the airplane mask mandate April 18th when it comes up for review. Why do you still argue for COVID19 mandates on the border? Why not fix immigration?
91,@EccMassive @davidhogg111 No one’s telling me to say anything. I’m not watching cable media. You must be as much as you b &amp; m about it. I do note all you do is criticize.

95,"@EccMassive @davidhogg111 In your reality 2017 through 20 Jan 2021 doesn't come after the year 2014. That's fantastic. Putin issued 650,000 internal Russian passports starting in 2019, first time since 1997. It was a precursor to invasion. Everyone knew it."
96,"@vikram_Singh002 @EccMassive @davidhogg111 I guess you forgot Afghanistan, Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, Iraq. Yeah, anyone can tell people what to do. Trump was in a position to do something about EU energy imports. What did he actually do? Nothing. You don't negotiate with a war criminal when he's getting weaker by the day"
