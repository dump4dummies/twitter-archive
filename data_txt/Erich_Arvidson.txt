1,What's the over/under on the number of people blocked by @EricGreitens  today?
2,Anyone in the political world (R or D) that tries to fundraise off of today's tragedy should feel deep shame.
3,"@Realtor_RScott @SaraForMissouri She split her home county in two and left them with representatives on opposite sides of the state. 

It benefitted the party, not the people."
4,"@SaraForMissouri You were running for a district and helped gerrymander yourself out of it? 

Best of luck in the future as a lobbyist"
5,@NBCNews That's not bullying. It's assault.
6,Is it free speech or $44bn speech?
7,"@AJWILLIKERS @KyleGarnerMO @JasonSmithMO Messaging is kind of the problem. Rural people listen when we run with the message ""all rural people are stupid and racist"" 

People don't vote for politicians that call them stupid. 

There's a generation of rural people that have only heard how awful Democrats think they are."
8,"@chadsp70 @KyleGarnerMO People diminishing the work of rural activists is one reason why we can't get more support. 

Why step up to support something when the armchair activists are going to cut you down?

I'd invite you out to canvass, but you don't seem the type to actually do any work to help."
9,It's kinda funny watching @EricGreitens  block everyone that brings up that he was indicted for felony invasion of privacy and resigned as Governor.
10,@AJWILLIKERS @KyleGarnerMO But it doesn't have to be that way. Those rural progressive voters are out there and we essentially sweep them under the rug. Electing democrats in statewide elections is possible if we don't write off rural voters. We can turn things around with even a couple statewide positions
11,"@chadsp70 @KyleGarnerMO And my point the entire time is that we need similar ""whole state"" strategies in the future. We can win, but we can't write off half the population in the state.."
12,"@chadsp70 @KyleGarnerMO You're trying to dunk, but are missing the point. 

Medicaid expansion would have failed without the yes votes in rural areas. 

The ""city"" votes alone couldn't have carried it.

All that to say, my team showed up in rural areas for Medicaid, and we found support. Enough to pass."
13,@susan_wegener @KyleGarnerMO Thanks for being out here and for fighting the fight! I work with a few groups to elevate rural voices. Holler if you need help getting plugged in with a local Dems group.

15,"@KyleGarnerMO I'm just saying that a white guy named Kyle from St Charles mansplaining rural issues to a former Congressional candidate is a bad look. 

I'm also saying that there is space for ""there are racists in rural MO"" and ""rural Missouri is not exclusively racist"" to both be true."
16,@KyleGarnerMO **coffee
17,"@KyleGarnerMO My bad. I thought you were interacting in good faith. You keep this narray and let me know if you ever are successful outside of Twitter or the STL area. 

My offer for coffins still valid though."
18,"@KyleGarnerMO Again. You come knock some doors out here with me and I'll show you that you're wrong. 

Are there racists out here? Yes. Are all rural voters motivated by racism? No. 

Shoot me a DM and we can get coffee about it."
19,"@KyleGarnerMO Let's try this. What have you done to change it?

You may not realize it, but you are looking down rural people and calling them all stupid. Surprisingly enough, people don't vote for politicians that call them stupid."
20,"@KyleGarnerMO Democrats have stopped working to bring normal rural people into the fold while trying to lump them in with the racists. We have retreated our support to the cities and rural people can tell. 

In summary-You keep generalizing, and you'll keep losing."
21,"@KyleGarnerMO And my point is that you're wrong. The main driver for voters in rural areas IS economic drivers. It's also representation. 

One party at least feigns to have your interest in mind while the other calls you racist. 1/"
22,@KyleGarnerMO That's weird. I did too. I was also successful in courting enough rural voters to expand Medicaid in this state. That was largely due to the fact that I didn't write off half the state as racist.
23,"@KyleGarnerMO You'll get 0% of the rural vote by calling all rural people racist. Come to visit sometime and I can show you how wrong you are. 

Sincerely,

A rural Democrat."

Who should we tag for a donation?

$50 allows one child to attend.

They'll learn how to grow food from local farmers and how to cook their harvest from local chefs!

28,"Just a reminder for the privatization crowd- companies only care about profits. And rural areas are rarely profitable. 

Rural folks will end up worse off, and our tax dollars will end up as bonuses for execs."
29,"@JasonBedrick @RiverRatDem It's about ALL students. 

Including the ones that remain at the school that are perpetually underfunded.

Folks that want to attend private school can do so on their own dime. 

You wouldn't suggest people take money from the police department to pay for private security."
30,"@JasonBedrick @RiverRatDem Let's try it this way- when tax dollars leave a public school and go to say a charter school, the public school loses money yes?

Our public schools in Missouri are already underfunded, losing more money will close more of our already struggling rural schools."

39,"@djtonystewart Because folks in charge were awful and needed to exploit people for money. Your tweet is not the dunk you think it is. Gwen Berry should still be allowed space to speak out in hopes of improvement. We should strive for true  equality, especiallybecause of previous failures."
