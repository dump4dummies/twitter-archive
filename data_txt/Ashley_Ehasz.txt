26,"My opponent Brian Fitzpatrick assumed office in 2016. Since then, he’s:

❌cut taxes for the rich
❌blocked paid family leave
❌voted to allow oil and gas companies to price gouge at the pump

With gas prices at $5.02/gallon in Bucks County, can we afford to keep him in office?"

34,"Let’s recap what my opponent won’t do to reduce gun violence:

❌ won’t ban assault rifles in our community
❌won’t hold gun manufacturers accountable
❌won’t stand up to his party for taking millions from the NRA and gun lobby  

In Congress, I WILL do this."
35,"@caringguy1957 @oldconn42 I appreciate your comment! But, here’s the reality: there was zero evidence of fraud, even in November, as we all know, as Trump’s advisors knew, and as Rep. Fitzpatrick knew. We need to hold our elected officials accountable for peddling the Big Lie, even if they flip flop."

37,"In the end @RepBrianFitz just can’t keep his stories straight. 

On Nov 7, 2020, he signed a letter to Gov Wolf asking for election fraud to be investigated, then on Jan 12, 2021, said that Trump has been lying.
