2,@raquellrussell @LPNational I think that roughly 100% of people consider the right to life as more important than the right to privacy. Whether or not you believe that this is an example of the right to life being violated is where most people differ.
3,@raquellrussell @LPNational None of that is what drives the reactions people have to this decision &amp; the banning of abortion in any state. And you know this.
4,"@raquellrussell @LPNational If insulting anyone who disagrees with you brings comfort then sure, but ownership of a handgun is not analogous to the deliberate act of ending a human life. If you disagree on the recognition of a human life then that’s fine, but it’s not even close to the same."

40,@raquellrussell @libertarianneko There’s no right to privacy to commit murder. The point on which this debate hinges is &amp; almost always has been whether or not the act in question constitutes murder. No one objects to privacy beyond that point.
41,"@raquellrussell Not quite the same, but that said, is it your belief that she would have sided with the majority to overturn it?"
42,"@libertarianneko @raquellrussell And as usual, this debate hinges on whether the “something” in question is recognized as a human being.

Listen: I don’t want to go down the rabbit hole on this topic. I’m only objecting to misrepresentation of the opposing view."
43,"@raquellrussell That’s a fine argument, but you’re misrepresenting the other side of the discussion.

PS - I don’t recall a single Democrat in my adult life who expressed hatred for the Roe decision."
