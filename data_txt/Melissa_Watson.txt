6,"To everyone who said to me when I was tweeting about #FreeBrittneyGriner before it was popular that she was not a political prisoner, I beg to differ. I been following this story. Here is Russia‚Äôs ask.

9,"I have never seen a civilized fight. If you are fighting it‚Äôs already uncivilized. Disagreement sure, but fighting nope. You can lose with dignity sure, but preparing to lose is for losers. Going through the motions is just an exercise in nothing &amp; a complete waste of resources."
10,I keep hearing these reports of Democrats being prepared to lose. You don‚Äôt prepare to lose.... You prepare to fight!! There is no such thing as a good loser. Who does that?
11,Total cost to renew my real estate license about $150. The total cost to renew my teacher certificate per credit hour about $230! The real estate  and insurance lobbyists in Cola. are well worth the money. Too bad it is illegal for teachers to UNIONIZE!
12,Why does it only take the SC Real Estate Commission 3 days to update my real estate license and the @EducationSC 3 months to update my teacher certificate with the information I sent digitally? The answer lobbyists. The inefficiency of @EducationSC is unreal.
13,Early Voting for the primary starts tomorrow.

18,He will go back to being a 99.9% Republican voter. He will still have the 3 poorest counties in the state which he will do nothing about. Sad.
19,"If @TomRiceSC7 wins today, it will be because of all those moderates and Dems who came over to vote for him today. Now, if he makes it back to DC will he remember?"

https://t.co/U88E3kP5Xx"
31,"There is still a war raging in Ukraine. With 3 recent mass shootings and 2 recent shootings in my community, kids in America also live in a war zone. We wouldn‚Äôt let a foreign country invade us so why does allow the NRA to kill us?"

66,No one should pay more interest for education than they do for their house. You aren‚Äôt canceling student loan debt. You are canceling the interest that prevented people from paying off the loan in the 1st place. $65k college debt should not become $15Ok. #CancelStudentDebt

77,"@jtoth1433 I didn‚Äôt originally tweet about BG b/c of the drug charges, but this üëáüèæ article especially makes me realize that there is more to the story. We don‚Äôt even know what was in the cartridge. I do think it is politically driven. https://t.co/KAd8kCn81F"
