14,@ScottKPetersen @davidsirota Roe was overturned because lying Democrats that promised to codify it never did because it gave them a political talking point to run on. Clinton is and was more dangerous than Trump. The edge of WW3 is a worse place to be. Dem voters need to own Dem inaction. You endorsed this!
