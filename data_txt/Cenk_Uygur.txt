2,2022-08-13 13:46:55+00:00,1558450028015824896,"What right-wingers are saying when they threaten civil war over Trump being investigated is - if you investigate our leader for being a criminal, we will commit violence against you. Not a great way of convincing us that you're not criminals."
3,2022-08-13 03:40:15+00:00,1558297354649759745,"Why isn’t it a priority for the Governor? He doesn’t need the legislature, he doesn’t need anything but his own signature. And since it’s intensely popular, it would pass easily and help drive voters to the polls. It’s unconscionable to not get his own voters a raise right now. https://t.co/CQK0ob4KeH"
4,2022-08-12 20:47:51+00:00,1558193569613037568,"First, they argued that there was nothing to raid Trump for. Then, they said the FBI planted documents. Now, they're saying that the documents were already secretly declassified by Trump. You guys really gotta make up your mind on what lie you're going with and stick with it."

They have no chance of winning an intellectual battle, so they resort to violence - thereby conceding that they have lost the battle of ideas."
6,2022-08-12 14:09:11+00:00,1558093241957773312,"What in the world would Trump be doing with top secret classified information about nuclear weapons? There is absolutely no reason why an ex-president should take that out of the White House, except one. That kind of info would be worth A LOT OF MONEY!"
7,2022-08-12 14:02:01+00:00,1558091439094976513,"I wonder if the cops are ever going to get tired of being targeted by the right-wing. The left wants cops to stop assaulting them, the right wants the right to assault cops. I'm pretty sure which one is worse, but I wonder when cops are going to figure out who the real threat is."

He had heard his whole life from the right-wing that his 2nd Amendment right was for fighting against and killing agents of government tyranny - law enforcement."
9,2022-08-11 19:39:46+00:00,1557814048531525632,"Trump supporters are amazing. They think the FBI, the whole government and everyone in media are lying (and that's fair on some counts). But they think the one guy in the country who is definitely not lying is Donald J. Trump. Really?! I can't stop being amazed by that."
10,2022-08-11 15:33:35+00:00,1557752095402369028,"We criticize Democrats ALL THE TIME. You know why? Because we're honest. Braindead MAGA clowns like you, on the other hand, don't ever honestly critize your own side. That's why you support Donald Trump, no matter how corrupt he is and how many laws he breaks. https://t.co/uYGF0fWzyt"
11,2022-08-11 14:42:45+00:00,1557739301684645895,"There is a unifying theme to everything Biden has passed-they’re almost all corporate subsidies. Subsidies to health insurance, semiconductor, construction, green energy &amp; fossil fuel companies. Some provisions help real people, but overall it’s a sophisticated corporate robbery. https://t.co/ESrweAxixU"

Tune out anyone who is a Trump supporter because they're declaring themselves a fan of a guy who is absolutely despicable. Why would you pay any attention to what the minions of a comic book villain have to say?
13,2022-08-11 14:04:33+00:00,1557729688075743237,"Law enforcement should pay zero attention to endless MAGA tears. It doesn't matter if Trump had committed the worst crimes imaginable and we had overwhelming evidence, MAGA idiots would declare deep state did it and would howl no matter what. Democracy must be protected!"
14,2022-08-11 13:45:57+00:00,1557725008356462592,Now pathetic @jimmy_dore is desperately trying to attract attention by attacking @ninaturner. Notice how he never lays a glove on Trump or any of his beloved right-wing friends but reserves all his vitriol for progressive leaders. Anyone who thinks he's on the left is a sucker!
15,2022-08-11 12:38:51+00:00,1557708120687661056,"Mainstream media has to work overtime to make you believe that this is ok. This is advocates for another country bribing our politicians. It doesn’t matter what country it is, it’s insane that we allow this. Any country can buy our politicians to work for them instead of America. https://t.co/5doxpojyvh"
16,2022-08-10 14:46:08+00:00,1557377764864323584,Is there anything Trump could be charged with that the right-wing wouldn't go nuts over? Is there any amount of evidence that would ever convince a right-winger that maybe Trump did it? He could actually shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and they would insist it was the deep state.
17,2022-08-10 13:40:49+00:00,1557361328150286339,"I wish the Democrats were 10% as tough as Republicans make them out to be. In their minds, Dark Brandon is real. In reality, it's a meme because of how funny the idea is that any Democrat would be tough against a Republican. God, the right-wing loves to cry and be victims! https://t.co/UfGg7uR83S"
18,2022-08-09 23:01:56+00:00,1557140149149978624,"This is such a great point. If Trump is so innocent, why doesn’t he just show us the warrant so we can see how flimsy it is? Maybe he can show us the long form. #ShowTheWarrant https://t.co/bv1rin1WGE"

21,2022-08-09 20:24:52+00:00,1557100622293323776,"Honestly, they're all criminals. More obvious bribes, more obvious gifts to the donors. This one was worth $35 billion. And it only took $1.4 million in bribes to DEMOCRATIC Senators. And did the media explain this ""historic"" robbery to you? I wonder why not? https://t.co/5wgV6mDf3t"
22,2022-08-09 19:56:24+00:00,1557093458845712384,The Republican Party is filled with lunatics like this. The mainstream media is way too soft on Republicans. This is not a legitimate political party. This psycopath would like to start a shooting war between the federal goverment and state troopers. https://t.co/E1RmPSPTI6
23,2022-08-09 19:24:32+00:00,1557085438245994497,The problem isn't that greasy hucksters like Steve Bannon and others are saying that Democrats are going to try to assassinate Trump. There will always be lunatics and grifters in the country. The problem is that an enormous percentage of the country will instantly believe it.
24,2022-08-09 18:36:08+00:00,1557073259203424258,Let's note that people all over American media think it makes sense to say this sentence: The FBI raiding the former President's house might have handed him the election.

27,2022-08-09 15:17:07+00:00,1557023173148676097,"What’s amazing is that the right-wing thinks that if they threaten to get mad, that Democrats &amp; officials will automatically back down - which has been the case for so long. But now that officials are not backing down when the right-wing yells, it’s confusing &amp; frustrating them."

What’s amazing about Republicans is that they don’t even bother to state an injustice. They think their side being held accountable is the injustice. “How dare they?!”"

31,2022-08-09 11:58:39+00:00,1556973227326377985,"I love the term Banana Republicans. Wanted to give credit. This is at least the first time I've heard it. Will use it from now on. So, for Banana Republicans, do they really think the FBI shouldn't investigate Trump if they think he broke the law (which he almost certainly did)? https://t.co/hW8Wo1oTwV"
