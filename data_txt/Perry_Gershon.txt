1,Notice Lee Zeldin one of only two NY republicans to oppose bipartisan Jan 6 commission. And he wants to be governor? https://t.co/x94NGeQlG4

4,@leezeldin Hardly your tone when your side controlled all of government just 4 years ago
5,It’s amazing how short @leezeldin ‘s memory is. Just 4 years ago his party controlled all of government and sought zero input from Democrats on anything. Hypocrite! https://t.co/Z79d7nkaNx
6,"@RepLeeZeldin I hope someone hacked you account and this is not real. If this is really @RepLeeZeldin , history will remember you on the wrong side."
7,@emmangoldstein @RepLeeZeldin voted in favor - would not want to disobey Boss Trump

11,@leezeldin Yes Lee. But most Americans by a large margin do not believe a new justice should be seated with a lifetime term before we get to@vote next month.
12,"RT @ngoroff: How many times have women heard men say ""all you have to do is submit and say yes""? Women don't do what we're told. We do what…"

15,"@SKrulder Tom Seaver remains the “franchise”.  To a Mets fan he is a virtual god. His dementia was horrible and well known. His death was accelerated by COVID, as has been the deaths of many elderly people in convalescent homes. It is part of the American tragedy."
16,@SKrulder And he died of COVID.  It’s not political.  It’s a fact.  Look at his death certificate. Science is science.
17,"Enough. Too many people are dying of COVID and our government does nothing. Too many loved ones, and now my boyhood idol is dead too. Please vote Democratic in November and stop this nightmare. #LGM #tomterrific #flipny01 https://t.co/AgODi0ewfz"
18,America is crying out for racial justice. That @RepLeeZeldin has yet to acknowledge peaceful protest should disqualify him from office. Look around your own district. https://t.co/laJCP0WGBt

20,RNC Speaker Cancelled After Boosting QAnon Conspiracy Theory About Jewish Plot to Enslave the World  https://t.co/O68Rrvyu5f via @thedailybeast
21,@PaulPaquette @RepLeeZeldin Funny how Walker neglected to mention that Donald Trump is generally credited with destroying the USFL after buying the NJ Generals and pushing the league to move its games to the fall (and compete directly with the NFL). The USFL is a perfect example of Trump’s destruction.
22,"For all his kissing up to Trump, putting party above Long Island, @RepLeeZeldin did not even make the official published RNC speakers list for Wednesday night (he is still scheduled to talk, just not deemed worth their highlight).  #poorLee #flipNY01 https://t.co/fuX2pPaO35"

28,"@ForRfb @PhilEhr @PhilArballo2020 @VoteAlaina2020 Actually, @ngoroff  won my primary.  She is the one who should defeat @RepLeeZeldin"
29,"In case there was any doubt on where his allegiance lies, @RepLeeZeldin yesterday voted against removing statues of Confederate heroes and white supremecists from the capital. 72 Republicans joined Democrats in a truly bipartisan vote. But Zeldin put Trump first, as usual."
30,"@d_mcelhone If you really want to learn more about me before you attack, send me an email to perry@perrygershon.com. I’d be happy to have a real conversation with you.  Then let you form your own opinions about me."
31,"@d_mcelhone On the other hand, if you care to really learn about the people you attack, I’d be happy to be ibn touch.  Email me at perry@perrygershon.com."
32,"@d_mcelhone Why dont you tell me about the coal and offshore rigging companies you think I am involved in?  Until you are up to that, I suggest you keep your self-important views to yourself.  I dont know you and you dont know me.  And I am happy keeping it that way."
33,"@d_mcelhone @SKrulder @Debfornow @ngoroff @RepLeeZeldin You have a great imagination about the way I live.  Sorry but no gated community.  And no fossil fuel investing.  Not now and not ever.  Just some lies other told about me, and you seem to be one who chose to believe them. Also you spell buy with a “u”.  What election did i buy?"
34,@d_mcelhone @SKrulder @Debfornow @ngoroff @RepLeeZeldin I suggest you go to school and learn about the people you choose to attack.
35,"@d_mcelhone @SKrulder @Debfornow @ngoroff @RepLeeZeldin Sorry chump.  You blew this one.  But I no longer matter.  I am not running for anything.  If it makes you feel good, I suppose, attack me all you want.  But the one who is damaging the district and putting politics first remains @RepLeeZeldin ."
36,"@d_mcelhone @SKrulder @Debfornow @ngoroff Amazing how small certain NY-1 Republicans can be. Fact - I have lived in East Hampton since 2000.  Paid taxes annually too.  And I am staying here.  And strongly supporting @ngoroff fro Congress over the real grifter, @RepLeeZeldin ."
37,@CO22300852 @cpcang @ngoroff very adult.
38,"Civics lesson for @RepLeeZeldin. Mayor DeBlasio is asking the USA to aid NYC, not personally asking the President for anything.  When you confuse the national interest with the personal business interest of its leader, something is all so very wrong. Why don’t you focus on LI? https://t.co/zL0s7rprH3"
39,"instead of fighting for a corrupt president who he is beholden to. I will remain visible, fighting with Nancy for the issues I care deeply about, and I look forward to continuing to work towards a better America, New York and most especially, a better Long Island. 4/4
#FlipNY1"
40,"more than four times the level of participation in 2016, the last presidential year. Zeldin must be defeated in November and Democrats have laid down the gauntlet that they are ready to take him on. We deserve a representative who will fight for Long Islanders, 3/4"
41,"for our families here in Suffolk. That journey goes on. Lee Zeldin continues to let us down in addressing Suffolk’s problems, and I am confident that Nancy will offer real solutions. I am encouraged that Democrats voted in historical numbers in our primary, 2/4"
42,"Earlier today, I called @ngoroff to congratulate her on a hard-fought win. Reflecting back on this whole experience, I must say that it was truly remarkable. I loved meeting with thousands of people over the last few years and discussing how we can make things better 1/4"

44,Semantics are everything. Not sure about “determining “ but just “investigating” a “strong possibility” of Russian bounties should be a MAJOR concern. Whose side is @RepLeeZeldin Lee Zeldin on? Trump’s or Long Island’s? https://t.co/gA0ZyzYLJt
45,"Where is @RepLeeZeldin?

Is he hiding in the bunker with @realDonaldTrump?

Russians are trying to kill Americans and our Congressman is nowhere to be found. 

Oh, now three months after the bounty became known, he says let’s get the facts. Faux urgency to protect the guilty. https://t.co/chMBJDRkbG"
46,"It’s been over 24 hours and not a word from @RepLeeZeldin on Russia trying to kill Americans in Afghanistan.

He’s more interested in protecting Trump’s corruption than protecting US soldiers.

Congress must investigate @nytimes bombshell - not go into hiding. 

@Newsday @News12 https://t.co/m8rCl9uZy2"
47,"Just when you thought things couldn't go lower, @POTUS tweets a video of his supporters yelling ""white power"" and uses words someone could interpret as an invitation to use violence against Joe Biden. Enough dividing us. More silence from @RepLeeZeldin assured. Vote in November. https://t.co/zXpvCTgc8m"
48,"Why hasn't @RepLeeZeldin spoken up about the failure of the Trump administration to publicly condemn these actions? Protection of our soldiers is the USA’s top priority, not praising Putin as some kind of “friend”.  I support our troops first. Full stop.

59,"America is for everyone. Especially those upon whose backs America was built.

Today, we honor Juneteenth. Tomorrow, we get back to work."
60,"In Congress, I will listen to those whose lives are impacted by racism and I will bring them into the conversation about how we stop racism, save Black lives, protect civil rights, and bend the arc toward justice."
61,"That's because of the systemic racism in our institutions, the deeply embedded racism in our culture, and the generational impact of centuries of racism.

I also know that I do not have the lived experience of Black residents in our community."
62,"In the midst of a pandemic, hundreds of thousands of Americans have gathered peacefully to speak out for racial justice and civil rights.

In any crisis — economic, health, natural disaster — it is almost always true that Black families bear the greatest brunt of the pain."
63,"Like most Americans, I was not taught about #Juneteenth in school. In fact, much of our history is white-washed, quite literally.

This Juneteenth, of course, comes at a powerful moment in our nation's history."
64,Supreme Court rule 5-4 against Trump keeping DACA alive. But we must still pass DACA provisions as well as comprehensive immigration reform.  That is why we must #flipNY01 and retire @RepLeeZeldin this November. https://t.co/PI9syDhrnK
