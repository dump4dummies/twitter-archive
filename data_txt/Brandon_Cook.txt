0,So I login this morning I am already blocked from following anyone new. I have not even been on here for 2 days. This is complete bull shit. I also see I have lost like 5k followers. I guess rant is probably useless as well being no one will see it anyway. Twitter can suck it. https://t.co/4pMUMwqc3m
1,@AngelaL91939871 That would be awesome. If I need it I will let you know.
2,RT @AngelaL91939871: I'll send some money for your bail
3,I put my sign up on the front door to my business. Only because I wanted to prove a point. I choose not to enforce the ridiculous mandate. I know I could be fined &amp; put in jail for not doing so. If We the People don't stand up for ourselves who will? May need bail money soon lol. https://t.co/kVGVfPzngn
4,Just posted my required sign on the door of my business. https://t.co/OvV11DCNwQ
5,@DonTheSEODude I will always have your back Sir. Thank you for your service. If you need anything send me a DM. I will answer the call just like you did for us.
6,"RT @DonTheSEODude: I left my family to fight 3 tours in Iraq. I came back changed. I was cold, filled with anger, grief and I lost the love‚Ä¶"
7,"The only reason Twitter is shutting down QAnon is because we are absolutely winning.

I personally have not seen 1 Biden bumper sticker or yard sign. I live in Wisconsin and own a business in Minnesota. I travel between these states every day and not 1.

Trump 2020!!!"
8,Well this should tell you everything you need to know. QAnon is as real as it gets people. There would absolutely no reason to censor or limit is it wasn't. https://t.co/QsqGDxRkdd
9,RT @samanthamarika1: If you aren‚Äôt talking about child sex trafficking because you think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúright wing‚Äù talking point or a conspiracy‚Ä¶
10,@kkennedy38 You're telling me I put my entire life savings and then some into opening my business. I own a used car dealership and service center.
11,Please get out and support the local businesses in your community. They need your help now more than ever.
12,I would however like to thank @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to start my own business. Without the great economy that he brought us I would of never been able to do this in the first place. A lot of great men and women are going through the same.
13,Sorry for my absence over the last couple weeks. I have been dealing with the reality that I may have to close my business due to this Covid BS. I just celebrated my 1st year &amp; this is a very hard decision to make. https://t.co/ggc54O0ROT
14,@JesseLa00558616 @realDonaldTrump Welcome Sir glad you joined the party.
15,@valstake If you read my tweet I did not say it was only the woman's responsibility. I did say after you have taken all available precautions. That does include a man and a condom. If they had a pill for men then yes but for now it has to be a condom.
16,I don't know who needs to hear this but right now is exactly why we have the #2ndAmendment. https://t.co/5FeUotAYtL
17,@StephMcMurphy @intranick Love that area my parents live in and own a liquor store in Long Beach.
18,@wild_borneo Sorry just a figure of speech.
19,@realDonaldTrump Patriots stand at the ready. If you don't stop these riots and the destruction of our cities we will. The call will go out and we will end this. 1000s of armed Patriots will come to each of these cities and we will restore order. This will end soon. https://t.co/Kz2feoayEV
20,@AnnS5853 Could not agree more with you on that.
21,"Now is the time to dust off those guns &amp; unpack your ammo. In very short time you will be called upon to defend our country, neighborhoods &amp; families. Patriots have been preparing for this but hoping we would never get the call. Antifa best get ready we will fight until the end. https://t.co/FBJwCMzM5M"
22,Antifa are Domestic Terrorists period. It is time for @realDonaldTrump to label them as so. Everyone involved in these riots and the destruction of these neighborhoods and businesses needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This has gone on way to long end it now. https://t.co/erGXSfPwLS
23,Well folks the time has come to defend our homes &amp; country. This rioting and looting is spreading across our country. I will be bringing my gun with to my shop from here forward. I suggest everyone start doing the same. My property and business will not be vandalized or looted. https://t.co/cPMd0KrnbS
24,"This crap going on in Minnesota right now isn't American. It's some shit you would see in a 3rd world country. Stop the crap this is not going to bring the justice you want, but hopefully justice will be brought to you. For God's sake you are burning down your own neighborhoods. https://t.co/hCxITfftyZ"

28,@valstake So if I'm getting you correctly. Abortions should only be preformed if you have taken all available precautions and still got pregnant. I don't have insurance by my choice so I would not be covered and I would be paying my own bill like I already do.
29,"The absolutely truth come Nov. 3rd  @realDonaldTrump will still be our President. He will also be the President of all you ""He's not our President people"".

32,"@valstake That is right typical Trumper and very proud of that. You are also right that if I get it that is my fault, and like most people that get it I will recover."
33,@valstake I would still not wear a mask. I'm not putting anyone down for doing so. If you are scared of getting the virus then wear one. That's your choice but it's also my choice not too.

1 yr 2 yrs 5 yrs? At some point enough is enough. The only thing holding us back is ourselves.

37,@Lilibet80283306 Unlike you obviously I don't live on Twitter. I have a life and a family and work 6 days a week running my business. My only day off is Sunday and I have stuff to do around my house that I don't have the time or energy for during the other six days.
38,@Lilibet80283306 @realDonaldTrump Republicans do not control Congress or the Supreme Court. Yes there is more conservative judges but we do not control them.
39,@Lilibet80283306 She lives 1900 miles from me and believe me she is not wearing one either.
40,We as a Nation have to stand up for ourselves. We need to stop following these unconstitutional orders given by our Governors. They are not laws and even if they were they would still be unconstitutional. We have allowed this to continue. I say no more RT if you agree. https://t.co/Bhke31Levz

48,We can not allow our so called elected leaders to control us by fear. We the People need to stop this shutdown in it's tracks. We need to return to our normal lives. If we allow this to happen now they will most definitely use this tactic again. Make America Ours Again #MAOA. https://t.co/TDcN7SH0Bz
49,If masks were really that helpful &amp; are keeping us safe how come we can't just open back up? Because they are not &amp; this is not about the virus at all. This is about @realDonaldTrump not getting reelected because @JoeBiden is the absolute worst presidential candidate possible. https://t.co/tNKVVvYkzC
50,We can not allow our election to go to mail in ballots. There is too much opportunity for tampering. If it has to come down to that then the election should be postponed or canceled completely. If Congress can't vote from remote locations then we don't either period. https://t.co/qxw5CU7Mj6

61,@jfwilb I could not agree more with you.
62,What is an essential employee? I believe all employees are essential all businesses are essential. If any job is essential if definitely is our lawmakers. Why are they not in DC working? They need to get back to work and now. Our country is in a crisis they helped to create. https://t.co/EVBSnPK8h3
63,I'm not sure what the ultimate goal is with this shutdown. One thing I am sure of is they are trying to hide something big. This is not good for We the People. We must stand our ground &amp; regain control of our country. We need to end the shutdown now. Make America Ours Again #MAOA https://t.co/a3LCpgV4Un

74,@stay_bill @scott_thereal There is plenty we as Americans can do. First &amp; foremost we need to vote &amp; we need to change the way we are voting. We need to stop electing the same people to office. We need to term limit career politicians. They will not do it to themselves. Things will change if we do that.
75,@stay_bill I'm not participating in the lock down. I have an essential job. I am a small business owner and I have seen a huge drop in customers. I also know other owners and some are about to shut down forever. We can not allow this to happen to our communities.
76,When this shutdown crap is over &amp; we get our lives back. We need to get out in our community &amp; support our local small businesses. Remember the times you went to them to support your child's sports or fundraising events or asked for donations for your groups. They need our help. https://t.co/sRoU3XGwC7
