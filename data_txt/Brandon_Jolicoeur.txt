1,@mayorcantrell Let‚Äôs hope that goes further than the almost 300 million spent over the last 5 years on New Orleans roads‚Ä¶lord knows where that money went
2,"@mayorcantrell It would also be nice to have somewhere to park during Mardi Gras, but you decided it was ok to tear up all the roads at the same time and not have any parking, absolute aces of an administration you‚Äôve got there! You‚Äôve won the award for Best Mismanagement! Congratulations‚Ä¶"
3,"@mayorcantrell If you actually wanted to hear from us, you‚Äôd actually answer questions and take phone calls about the ridiculous state of our streets and why so many roads are torn up with no repairs being made, and why it‚Äôs taking years to repair a street like Catina St in the Navarre for one"

12,@mayorcantrell @NOLACityCouncil  why is the city‚Äôs coordination and planning so messed up that the people who tear up the roads have a separate budget than the ones putting it back? Why separate crews? Why doesn‚Äôt one crew go directly behind the other crew? Who coordinates this!? https://t.co/OAts4Rzpj8
13,"@LSU  can you give some clarification on who is paying the $95 million? Is it the school or the TAF? If it is the school, can you explain why, when you have so many struggling with student loans and ridiculous education costs?"
14,"@CityOfNOLA @mayorcantrell can you please fix these shitty ass streets, we have the worse ones in the country, and y‚Äôall taking your sweet ass time w/ this shit, this one has been like this since at least January that I‚Äôm aware of, On Dumaine@Carrollton https://t.co/2FsoEVvrIt"

21,"@JoAnnLChateau Like @JaneGoodallInst says, we need to work with corporations, not to try to shut them out or shut them down, but to make sure that they are progressing in the right direction, taking care of their employees and caring for our world and our environment"
22,"@JoAnnLChateau I have said before that IF a corporation were to offer me money, I would happily accept those funds, because they already know that I will use that money to fight corporate greed and to fight pollution and ensure that corporations are held accountable for their actions."
