19,@ChasCityPaper I would do more than thoughts and prayers. I would actually vote for gun reform. Gun rights are no more absolute than any other rights. Did you ask this question of @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @votetimscott neither of whom have done much to further the debate on gun reform or gun safety.
