1,"@kaceyjanejames @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices I see something completely different than you. I am not debating China abuses human rights, but not all companies in China use slaves, and you are providing no direct sources to back your claim. I don't know why we are seeing different things on that page. https://t.co/Mlx7NVqcIe"
2,@kaceyjanejames @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices Where is this data from? Do you know those companies use slave labor or just because they are Chinese you assume so?
3,@kaceyjanejames @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices A lot of what I am seeing is that USA has a major garlic and onion production/export and a bulk of the worlds spices are from India. I don't see anything on penzeys specifically.

13,"@LanceThornton19 @Brandonk223 @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices I love that you made 2 comments to insult me because there is pepper from a mill where the mill goes and then topped it off with sexism.

14,"@Brandonk223 @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices If I had 5 jars of spices is that hoarding? Where is the quantity line?

17,"@Brandonk223 @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices I wipe it up every few weeks, but there are well over 75 different jars of spices in that cabinet, is that just common? Not to mention the bulk bags for refilling. Most spice racks and sets are no more than 24. How many do you have?"
18,@Brandonk223 @iheartliberty @PenzeysSpices I love to cook and use spices so I am a hoarder? Before I was a liar for saying I had a lot of spices.

24,"@TucksJones @csuwildcat @swelljoe @justinamash @joerogan Business decisions are not free speech decisions.

The first amendment is government can't stop you from voicing opinions.

52,"@RubenJHenriquez @MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC You can just stop after the first sentence before the but. The government should step up. If you think this situation is the fault of the renters, it is not. If the government isn't stepping up then vote for someone better, organize and do something different because this sucks."
53,@RubenJHenriquez @MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC Imagine having no compassion during a once in a lifetime event responsible for the deaths of a million Americans and thinking that making people homeless is the best option. Instead of spending time bitching on twtr about renters focus on the leadership failures that got us here.
54,"@MiloDaytona @RubenJHenriquez @James21700046 @AOC To be fair, there are a lot of predatory and terrible landlords out there. I believe that shelter is a right we should all have in the richest country in the world but it all comes down to poor goverment leadership, especially in 2020."
55,"@RubenJHenriquez @MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC They have literally given trillions of dollars to companies to prevent major market collapse this pandemic. If instead they would have just given every citizen 90% of their salaries no matter what we wouldn't be here today and it would have saved money. 

Bad Policies!"
56,"@RubenJHenriquez @MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC The whole reason there was a moratorium was because this is an ""act of god"" that is not in leases and has extenuating circumstances. If tenants aren't able to pay because of the pandemic then the government should freeze the mortgage payments of the property owners, it is simple."
57,"@RubenJHenriquez @MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC I am not blaming anyone. I am saying that if people expect tenants to always magically have rent money or get evicted in an international emergency then landlords should be expected to do the same.

And I do believe that it is shit policies from the government that are the issue."
58,"@MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC Evicting millions of people is just going to make stuff worse and if you want it to be different then vote for different people in government. Other countries guaranteed wages through the pandemic, we gave people $3,000 and business trillions. You're picking the wrong fight."
59,@MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC You can't put all the onus onto renters not being able to afford to live through an international pandemic. Landlords need to take responsibility also. If you are saying one party needed to be responsible enough to save 1yr+ of rent then the other party should do the same.
60,@MiloDaytona @James21700046 @AOC Landlords should have planned ahead and saved up enough to cover mortgages on buildings for 1.5 years if renters are required the same thing. So many landlords live rent check to rent check without planning ahead for major pandemics and it is an issue that affects families.
