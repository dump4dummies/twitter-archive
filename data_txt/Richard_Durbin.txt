23,"This bipartisan gun safety framework is a step in the right direction that will help strengthen our background checks, fund red flag laws, close loopholes, and more. But itâ€™s not enough â€“ and Iâ€™m focused on delivering more legislation and action."
24,"The ATF has remained without a Senate-confirmed director since 2015 because, in part, gun lobbyists have fought to keep it that way. Itâ€™s time to change that by confirming the exceedingly-qualified Steve Dettelbach.
https://t.co/pepBaCq8Jb"

Iâ€™m focused on defending a womanâ€™s right to make deeply personal decisions about her body and future."

https://t.co/pcogtij5ue"

Iâ€™ve worked hard to advocate for our stateâ€™s infrastructure through federal funding, legislation, and more â€“ and Iâ€™m glad to see it paying off in this $15 million in federal funding from the FAA. https://t.co/pheCXS4n3J"
42,Every one of the Buffalo victims left behind loved ones who are grieving their loss. Iâ€™m not going to sit back and let their memories fade â€“ Iâ€™m fighting to pass common sense gun reform and legislation that combats white supremacist domestic terrorism.
43,"In the past month, Republicans have voted against:
