26,@BlackCoffeeJust @RPowellDennis97 I'm honored.
27,@RPowellDennis97 A6: Many of our wraparound needs are public health problems that need a complete public health solution. Districts need to work with municipal governments and non-profit orgs for a full public health partnership approach to provide these services.
28,@primer4tn84 @RPowellDennis97 https://t.co/ebUoycWN6U
29,@RPowellDennis97 A5: Districts must provide continuous PD on developing and delivering content online. They should ensure that the curriculum companies are tailoring their training and support to a mostly online delivery medium.

36,"@Capo_DP Bruh, I'm cryin...felt the same way the first time."
37,@RPowellDennis97 A3: Community leaders should work with legislators to present legislation that links education funding to prison funding. Every increase in prison funding should increase education funding to be sustained for 3 years after the increase.
38,@CortDotEdu @RPowellDennis97 Those programs know how to improve outcomes and should have increased resources or larger access.

40,@RPowellDennis97 A1: States/districts will only consider what parents make them consider. Our community must petition for our children to be a part of tomorrow‚Äôs economy and educated for it today. Communities should create alternative curriculum that speak to our children 's experiences.
