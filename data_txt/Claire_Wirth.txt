14,"The government is all ""Monkeypox, Monkeypox"" and I'm all ""name the Source of the SCOTUS leak""."
15,"The Left has so much control over the media, that everyone moved on from the unprecedented &amp; intentional leak from SCOTUS a few weeks ago.

Divide and distract, works every time."
16,The media keeps telling us that Monkeypox comes from Africa but has a hard time saying where COVID comes from.
17,Just a reminder that the people who fabricated the Russian collusion hoax are the same people running the January 6th committee
18,"Barely two years in and the Leftists are understanding the cost of no ""mean tweets"".

Hate, division, $7 a gallon gasoline, and baby food shortages.

Was it worth it?"

20,"Imagine if this administration was honest about the millions of taxpayer dollars they've spent to fund the promotion of puberty blockers, double mastectomies and prosthetic genitalia for kids.

They would lose elections and that's why they hide it."
21,"Biden:

1) Bans oil from Russia (run by dictator who brutally invaded a neighbor).

2) Buys oil from Venezuela (run by dictator who brutally oppresses his own people).

Why not restore US oil production and stop doing business with dictators altogether?"
22,"The fact that no one made a big deal about Bush's ""gaffe"" on Iraq shows you how accustomed we have become to Biden's regular disasters."
23,"While George W. Bush and Iraq are trending, let's remember that Biden was instrumental in starting the Iraq war.

As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he pushed for intervention before voting for it. 

I'm sure this conflict will be different."
24,"The only reason Joe Biden was in Buffalo was to exploit Black Americans for political purposes.

Compassion is alien to the Democrats."
25,"While a stockpile of baby formula sits at the Southern Border, 26 of our states are almost completely out. 

If we cannot care for own, how can we care for others?"
26,I know the Left has successfully moved the focus onto several other topics but sometimes I just like to remind everyone that lockdowns did more damage than the virus.
27,How is anyone NOT OUTRAGED that nothing is being spent on or done for America and Americans by this government?
28,The war no one is talking about is the one Joe Biden is waging on Americans.
29,"Sweden has not been at war since the Norwegian War of Independence in 1814. 

It stayed neutral during the first and second World Wars.

Now, 208 years later, they‚Äôre all in against Russia.

What happened?"

33,@dbc603 @RepThomasMassie Thank you David!
34,A nation unable to ensure its people have a supply of baby formula has no business giving billions of dollars to anyone.
35,Biden's America is where crack pipes are easier to find than baby formula.

You get what you vote for."

Remember that when we vote in November."
41,"Don't be fooled.

They just tolerate us because they love our money.

."

44,Not even COVID had an approval rating as low as Congress currently has.
45,Only the Democrats would think that after spending 20 years and $2.313 trillion on a failed regime change in Afghanistan we should spend $40 billion and try another one against a nuclear power.

49,Big day in showbiz yesterday when $40billion officially became the highest amount ever earned by an actor.
50,We live in an America that protects leftist school board members better than it does Supreme Court justices.
51,"Just to be clear last night, all 57 House Members that voted not to send another $40 billion to Ukraine, were Republicans.

Not a single Democrat voted against it."
52,You can tell the Democrats are in charge when the streets are full of Fentanyl but the stores are short on baby formula.
53,"There is no right to abortion in the Constitution &amp; the left knows that so their tactic is to change the subject to the fiction that the justices are out to get the LBGTQ community or interracial marriage. It's simple fearmongering. 

This is what a real insurrection looks like."

63,"I see the Lincoln Project is in the news again.

I wonder which one of their members got caught with child pornography this time."
64,"The Left is already preparing the mob.

As always they instigate &amp; incite, then act like they play no part in the threat of violence, unrest, destruction or physical intimidation that follows.

All to get the judicial branch of government to give them the decision they want."
65,"Dan Crenshaw &amp; Mitt Romney are two pillars of the Trans community that don't get the appreciation they deserve. 

As two proud Transrepublicans, a minority group that associate as Republicans despite being Democrats.

I salute you."

67,"The whole time we were ""locked down‚Äù, the border was wide open.

It's never been about the science."

The options are still there, use them."
70,"The fact that New White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is in a relationship with - CNN anchor shows that even with Psaki gone it will be business as usual.

By that, I mean a complete conflict of interest and peddling lies to the American people."
71,"A massive PR firm that represents high-profile corporations like 
Coca Cola, Netflix &amp; Starbucks is privately advising clients to avoid commenting on abortion rights.

This is the direct result of Ron DeSantis sticking to his guns. 

The tide has turned on the Woke corporations"
72,"It speaks volumes that the Scotus leak, a flagrant insurrection against America‚Äôs judicial system is ""no big deal"" according to Adam Schiff

Two sets of rules, one for them and another for us."
73,"The Ministry of Truth is a golden gift for conservatives.

A glorified fake-jobs program that won't amount to anything substantial except to allow us to prove once &amp; for all that the Democrats are nothing but information tyrants and hypocrites afraid of personal freedom."
74,"Don't mistake the ""disinformation experts"" for being stupid.

They act it but they are not.

That‚Äôs what makes them dangerous.

The way to beat them is to discredit &amp; reveal their stupidity in public!"
75,"Major companies like Disney, Walmart and American Airlines that are routinely vocal about leftist causes, have been silent amidst the Roe v Wade leak.

The Left is the elite and serves only the elite.

The American people are just the shoulders they stand on to obtain their desires."
82,"Dams, bridges, roads‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs infrastructure. 

You what the Left thinks is infrastructure? 

Critical Race Theory, the green new deal, and mass amnesty. 

See the problem?"

84,It is grossly unfair to expect Biden to deal with all of the domestic priorities when he is so busy escalating a proxy war he in Eastern Europe.
85,"Like the many unexplainable coincidences that surround this administration, we are told to blindly support a foreign nation that is the same one Joe Biden's son is deeply connected to.   

Go figure."

Today the Left can't define what a woman even is."
87,"Corporations are neither ""right"" nor ""left"", they are ambiguously authoritative. 

They have the power to convince both sides that they represent one or the other. 

The truth is they always represent themselves and their profits."
88,"With the midterms around the corner, I wouldn't be surprised if we see another ""mostly peaceful"" summer.  

Just like the 2020 elections, the Democrats will find or fabricate a pretext to throw the country into chaos, just before we vote.

It's what they do."
89,"Democrats constantly call for saving democracy, but not our Republic and they sure are afraid of the US Constitution.

The only reason in the last few weeks they've been saying democracy is at risk, is because their version of democracy is cheating to win."
90,"In two years Democrats have forfeited their go to abortion arguments. 

You can't mandate &amp; threaten people to inject themselves with vaccines, then say ""my body my choice""  &amp; if we can no longer define what a woman is, how do we define what a ""woman's issue"" is?"
91,"Elon was one of Obama's biggest donors, Tulsi Gabbard endorsed both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, and Joe Rogan was a huge Bernie Sanders supporter. 

But according to the media, these people are all ""Right Wingers"". 

Just goes to show how far to the left the Dems have gone."

96,"Just like every other branch of the government this administration has used against us, the Ministry of Truth's loyalty will always be to the regime and never the people."
97,"Deflection is the main reason for the NYT attacking Tucker Carlson.

This is what happens when all the ""conspiracy theories"" about the Left turn out to be true."
