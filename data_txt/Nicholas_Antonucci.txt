83,"@gaiabiz 3c-There are other items to mention that get me frustrated, like when some people call themselves ‚Äúsurvivors‚Äù rather than ‚Äúvictim‚Äù because it may make them sound weak. IMHO there‚Äôs a link here to bootstrap mentality &amp; the idea we‚Äôre responsible for everything that happens to them"
84,"@gaiabiz 3b-The same is true with working families or the poor. Like too many I know personally, these folks can work their hardest and not move up the financial ladder at all."
85,"@gaiabiz 3a-I‚Äôve heard the argument that CEOs work harder than anyone else for 80 hours a week, but income disparity is HUGE. Can we really compare a CEO work week with a low-income person working three jobs? We know wealthy folks become wealthy through family fortune or other factors."
86,@gaiabiz 3-How to counter the bootstrap mentality? I‚Äôm not sure I have a good enough answer to this one. I recognize it as an important issue. A belief that hard work lifts one out of poverty is so harmful because it ignores the complexity of soc. &amp; eco factors &amp; its role in one‚Äôs life.
87,"@gaiabiz 2b - I‚Äôll admit that my vision is pretty ambitious for an MS teacher. Still, I am convinced it can be done in cooperation with government and the private sector, including unions and a reformed education system."
88,"@gaiabiz 2a - Let‚Äôs also consider how we teach students - K-12 and Higher Ed - both must keep pace with new technologies. I also cannot stress this enough: l learning must be cross-disciplinary, more personalized (Hire more teachers), and it needs to be more focused on human skills."
89,"@gaiabiz 2 - How do we educate the workforce for the future?
As an educator, I see many factors that are radically changing how we work, and they are not being addressed head-on, such as automation and the gig economy."
90,"@gaiabiz 1d - Think of it this way: if no one pays dues, unions have no way to provide any union benefits. And that means lower wages."
91,"@gaiabiz 1c - Check it out - these ‚Äúright to work‚Äù laws allow workers not to pay union dues, but they are entitled to all the benefits of being in a union. This is wrong! It‚Äôs an underhanded way of destroying unions."
92,"@gaiabiz 1b - Next, build real penalties for companies that violate labor laws by firing workers who try to organize a union or intimidating others. Critically important is that federal laws must be enacted that pre-empts so-called state ‚Äúright-to-work‚Äù laws."
93,"@gaiabiz 1a - How do we strengthen unions?
I believe that to get the average Americans a fair share of the gains from economic growth, they need to unionize.
Laws are needed to make it easier to form a union with a simple majority of workers voting up or down."
