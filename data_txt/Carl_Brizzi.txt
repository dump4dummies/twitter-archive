5,"I know something about following evidence &amp; find this account less than credible. It was a conversation between two people. Trump wasn’t Woodward’s source, and neither was Pence.

42,@adamwren @Victoria_Spartz @SubstackInc @hamishmckenzie Nothing to see here folks..move along. David McIntosh and his dark money goon organization has put the 5th CD in serious peril. Nothing about Spartz's finances ever made sense. How does one spend more personal money on a campaign then reported on a personal financial disclosure?

53,Look... Marrying a man for his father’s money isn’t inherently wrong. What is wrong though is using that father’s money to fund your campaign. And then also lying to the federal government about it. Two wrongs don’t make a right. #IN05

-Single payer is not the answer. -Government is not the answer. -Transparency is a must. 
-Almost one trillion dollars of fraud waste in the healthcare system. Let’s start there."
81,We ARE at war. The enemy is the virus. What makes me different is I’m a battle tested prosecutor and I’ve investigated deception within the Chinese government. And that’s what we’re seeing here. We CAN make China pay. We can stop buying Chinese goods. We can impose sanctions.
82,"I’m running because our liberties, particularly the first and second amendment, are in peril. Also, we must hold China accountable. I am the only person running who HAS investigated the corrupt Chinese government. I’m the right person at the right time."
