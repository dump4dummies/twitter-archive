10,"Well I got some good news the district has been changing. The is 120k registered Republicans and 90k registered Democrats. That is a coin toss. If we can get every Democrat to vote, we can flip the 10th!!!"
11,I hope everyone had a wonderful day. I've been lucky to talk to a lot of Democrats lately. Some seem depressed about how gerrymandered the district is. That there is very little chance of a democrat becoming a congressperson in the 10th.
12,What  makes you not trust Congress? For me its the lack of transparency.
