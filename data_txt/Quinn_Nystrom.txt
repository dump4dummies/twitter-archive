44,@LovesUSA2 @nypost The NY Post is not a legit media outlet. Read the fine print in the actual order…it in fact does nothing to lower the cost of insulin. No US President has done anything to drop the price of insulin.
45,"@MarcusPouliot @PeteStauber No he did not. He signed an executive order that he tried to have pass as lowering the cost of insulin, but it in fact did nothing. No President has lowered the price of insulin."
46,"@westerntc55 @PeteStauber We’ve allowed for a free market here in the US for insulin, and all that’s happened is the price has increased 1200% in the last 20 years."
47,"Are you struggling to afford insulin right now? Would you be comfortable sharing your story with the media? If yes to both, let me know. #insulin4all #MNinsulin4all"
