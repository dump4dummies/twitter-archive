17,I can't wait to see these two smug faces when we take this Senate seat and Missouri becomes the deciding vote to abolish the filibuster and to codify Roe. We deserve to be proud of our state for once. Send me to Washington and let's make it happen. https://t.co/bzA0kOU75K
18,@DarrenJxn I told you I was going to run a different kind of campaign!
19,"@vetskeptic @RayReedMO @LucasKunceMO @buschvalentine @TrishForMO I've consistently stated that abortion is healthcare and that healthcare is a human right. I'm proud to shout it today, and when I get to D.C. it will be codified as such."

We can hope that someone will help us in the future, or that money will convince people that we care about them--or we can earn trust by living our values. You know where I stand. The choice is yours. LFG! 17/17 https://t.co/UaQiab1ekr"
40,"I also put my money where my mouth is. I've largely self-funded the campaign to date, becuase I knew that if I spent all my time fundraising, I couldn't impact nearly as many lives. I believe that Missourians should be a candidate's primary focus...Not money. 16/"
41,"I'm proud that 10% of the funds I raise in the general election will be reserved for long term growth of Democratic infrastructure in Missouri. Politics shouldn't be about money, and my goal is for Democrats to be competitive in every district of our state. 15/"

46,"Arguably, the most impactful action that we've taken is helping over 10,000 Missourians apply for Medicaid. Healthcare is a human right, and when I get to Washington, we'll pass Medicare for All. In the meantime, we'll do everything we can to help. https://t.co/deZUIsh6Gg 10/"

69,@amandaehll Congratulations! What a great milestone. I honestly couldn't contain my emotions last night.
70,"Being new to politics, it is incredible to see how many emails, tweets, and videos politicians put out that are written by consultants. I'm proud that everything that comes from my campaign is authentically me. Anyone can hire a copywriter or read a script. We deserve better."

76,"@populistjoint @LucasKunceMO @EricGreitens I honestly don't care for political games when people are getting death threats. A good candidate should be able to communicate a future that energizes people to vote against any of the Republcian candidates without putting others in danger.

https://t.co/eIN5qfdHaO"
77,"@LucasKunceMO @EricGreitens @LucasKunceMO please stop. Missourians don't want Greitens in the Senate. He is only getting 25%-35% support in his own party, but when you give oxygen to his movement, you hurt us all. That's what he wants. Just take it down. It's not worth it."
78,I'm sick of politicians running for office who are all talk and who don't live the values they say they will support when in office.

79,There's nothing strategic or smart in platforming hate. The short-term gain of Twitter donors is nothing compared to the damage to our society and the lives that will be lost to violence inspired by these extremists. Stop feeding the fire. @LucasKunceMO
80,"This! This, over and over! He put out the video out to raise money when hateful people see it. It may feel good to get retweets, likes, and raise money off of his grotesque behavior, but you're literally putting my family in danger and your giving him the platform he wants. Stop! https://t.co/zx0XcVStCa"
81,"I'm sure there are a lot of reasons that would have made being in a parade today the right decision. We participate in many parades as allies. But, someone I respect trusted me and felt comfortable giving me their advice, and I trusted them and took it. Happy Juneteenth. 4/4"
82,"We didn't walk in a parade. My campaign team talked about it extensively and ultimately a team member requested that we not try center this holiday around me, a white political candidate. I'm proud to have such thoughtful and diverse people advising me. 3/4"

99,"There are 330M people in America. What are the odds of being 1 of 6 to use your authority to overturn Roe, while your wife is randomly smilutaneously attacking our country...somehow without you knowing it? I look forward to going to D.C. to hold them accountable in the Senate."
