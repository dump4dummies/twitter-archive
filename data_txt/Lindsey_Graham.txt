1,"The Court rightfully held that a football coach praying alone in view of his players is not a violation of the Constitution, but rather protected religious and free speech activity under the First Amendment. 

This is a common-sense ruling."

I believe it was one of the largest power grabs in the history of the Supreme Court."
