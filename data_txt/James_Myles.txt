0,I just heard the Supreme Court issued another key decision in the protection of our First Amendment Rights.  I look forward to reading the decision.  Congratulations to Coach Kennedy!
1,A great event today.  My proposed “Parents’ Protection Act” was a huge hit.  In concept this federal law would also bar any Virginia public school from providing any pornography or instruction regarding sexual or gender identity issues to children in Pre-K through 6th grade.
2,A great evening at the huge Sang Yi event in Fairfax.  Had a chance to meet and discuss our campaign with Governor Youngkin and Pat Herrity and Sang Yi.  Full speed ahead to November! https://t.co/C5gwVKiSN5
3,I have just heard that Roe v Wade has been overturned with the abortion rights questions returned to the states.  I look forward to reading the decision. Let’s hope and pray that our elected officials protect us all from any related violence.
4,"A new experience, the City of Fairfax Republican Committee meeting. It was no surprise that Fairfax City residents are as disappointed as Fairfax County residents in runaway inflation, exorbitant gas prices and failing schools.  Woke policies are failing our communities."
5,Governor Youngkin gave an inspired speech enjoyed by all!  He even found time after to catch up with me.  His words of encouragement and support for my campaign were very much appreciated.  We can win this in November! https://t.co/whghg0XWdf
6,The Governor has arrived! https://t.co/HDt8LRM6Ur
7,Can’t wait for the Governor to arrive-so much excitement in the air! https://t.co/CsTviZopc4
8,"Send me to Congress! I will work to enact legislation to provide parents with a federal right to stop their children’s political indoctrination, sexualization, any gender identity interference in public schools. We must allow parents, the most qualified, to raise their children"
9,Our Republican field of 11 outstanding candidates is set.  Together we stand ready to return to the sane policies that benefit all Virginians and we will take back the House in the fall!  Proud and humbled to be included with such great company.  On to multiple wins in November!
10,"Great interview with the Korea Times.  Talked about my military service that involved a year in South Korea and our shared values of faith, family, hard-work and the importance of providing our children with an outstanding education! https://t.co/pYhKh629Go"
11,"Saw the Washington Times lead story today, consistent with my tweet yesterday on parental rights.  Our public schools are not equipped to handle our children’s sexual, gender identity and mental health issues. These are for parents and families to address privately."
12,"June 19th is the day we remember and celebrate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S., a great day for all Americans!"
13,Happy Father’s Day to all the fathers and all who have stepped in to father.  We all know how important fathers are to our children’s health and success. https://t.co/8EDumCf7RP

15,"Fairfax County - together, we can use Congress to consider civil rights protections for parents and caregivers of children. If schools see an issue with a child they involve the parents.  Schools should educate and stay out of sexual and gender issues.  Schools are not qualified."
16,"A very nice morning in King’s Park.  Benches to honor two outstanding Fairfax County Supervisors, Sharon Bulova, also serving our communities as Chair, and John Cook (pictured).  My opponent (pictured) discussed their history of bipartisanship.  I will bring that to Congress. https://t.co/vEDbGdS07o"
17,The rally before the FCPS Board meeting was exciting and well attended.  Sebastian Gorka presented a compelling case on the dangers of the proposed policy changes.  I was able to add the losses we are seeing in the quality of our children’s education are quite troubling. https://t.co/uGRePhNNuA
18,"A great evening with conservative friends and great Americans. Larry O’Connor led an evening with guests Elizabeth Schultz, and Mercedes and Matt Schlapp.  Great speeches, a video clip preview and questions and answers, a wonderful evening.  So proud to be a Republican! https://t.co/UDaO0ZbOl5"
19,"Happy Flag Day!  Sadly, I recently read a large percentage of our school aged children do not know how many stars are on our flag or what they symbolize.  We must do a better job in our public schools to teach basic civics, not about going to radical left protests. https://t.co/jbNEweN2LE"
20,"Much to learn from Ms. Betsy DeVos, today’s guest speaker at the Republican Women’s Federal Forum luncheon on Capitol Hill.  If only she led our schools the kids would be so much better off, all our kids!  Amazon has her new book, “Hostages No More” it’s worth reading! https://t.co/xgR4R9VySU"

37,"I see my opponent has finally noticed the baby formula crisis that the Democrats and their operatives helped to create.  Close down a, if not the, major producer of baby formula without any plan? Give the left time and they will start to blame the infants!!!"
