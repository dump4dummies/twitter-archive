Congratulations and good luck to you Judge Amy Coney Barrett. #SCOTUS"

59,14-I suggest that we verify &amp; assure that the Postal Service has adequate capacity to deliver all election mail securely (the Postmaster General assures us is the case) &amp; that we leverage any funding we may choose to provide so that our Post Office remains viable #USPS #OR02 #End
60,"13- Yes, the President’s remarks lend themselves to political blowback.  But let’s do our best to focus on two things: First, can we do anything to improve mail delivery between now and November 3rd? Second, can we fix the US Postal Service for the long term?  #USPS #OR02"
61,"12- In recognition of this, the Trump Administration has negotiated a ten-billion-dollar loan to the USPS to assure that it can operate into 2021. #USPS #OR02"
62,"President Trump may well be correct when he said, “You can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.” The fact is, millions of mail-in ballots, regardless of universal mail-in voting, will soon be dropped into the mail. #USPS #OR02"
63,"11- Change of any sort, no matter how justified, innocuous or necessary just 80 days before a presidential election, provides a ready-made opportunity for howls of outrage from unions, politicians and the liberal media. #USPS #OR02"
64,"10- And as he (Post Master General) acts to stem the tsunami of losses, by cutting back on overtime and prioritizing services, he is being blamed for interfering with the election process. #USPS #OR02"
65,"9- Today, as the Postmaster General fights to reorganize a business that is compelled to deliver the mail (&amp; pre-fund billions needed for the US Postal Service retirement plan) without having any control over what it charges, the USPS continues to hemorrhage billions. #USPS #OR02"
66,8- Lots of political power to obstruct change. (And let’s not mention legislators like me who see expensive services in rural and remote areas as a matter of community survival.) #USPS #OR02
67,"7-...were not taken and now we are suffering the consequences. The USPS has lost 78 billion dollars since 2007. Downsizing is hard when the Service employs some 600,000 people, organized in seven different unions. #USPS #OR02"
68,"6 -There was grudging agreement that this was the likely outcome. Most of those post offices survived.

Sadly, the unpleasant steps needed to allow the US Postal Service to be financially viable, such as giving it the power to raise its prices...#USPS #OR02"
69,5 - I also frequently reminded those living in these communities that the post office financial model was flawed and that if we wanted these services to survive it was very likely we would all have to pay more. #USPS #OR02
70,4 - and a way to move products produced in rural communities into commerce. I argued fervently that these offices should not be closed. #USPS #OR02
71,"3- ...arguing that rural post offices were often all that was left of a small town and served as a community center, a means of keeping elderly people (including veterans) in their rural homes (because they could still get medicine through the mail) #USPS #OR02"
72,"2- When I represented rural Oregon in the Legislature, there was an attempt to save money by closing down rural post offices. I attended as many of the proposed closure meetings as I could all across my district...#USPS #OR02"
73,1 - The United States Postal Service is the poster child for what happens when politicians run a business. Things turn out badly. #USPS #OR02 #Thread
