21,"@Vote_CNP @Adakisn Modesto resident, it's firmly red. We are poor. We are afraid of rising prices from bay area's success."
22,@Vote_CNP @Adakisn A lot of the central valley residents disagree with the rest of CA. Would  certainly be interesting to see what the potential state borders would be.
23,"@Vote_CNP @Adakisn Maybe some of norcal is given to even the population, maybe around Sacramento."
24,"@Adakisn @Vote_CNP @CascadiaDept Reno, Las Vegas. Maybe. They are near the border."
25,@Vote_CNP @Adakisn I think we would be stronger as an independent nation. The red states don't want us anyway. Lol
26,"@Vote_CNP @Adakisn @CascadiaDept Or Louisiana, they are sinking. They need a lot of help."
27,@Vote_CNP @Adakisn @CascadiaDept I think Florida is in the worst position.
28,@Adakisn @Vote_CNP The part that worries me is that Canada would also potentially lose territory to the new state. (Vancouver) making enemies of both our neighbors would probably be bad... Mexico would probably like it.
29,"@Adakisn @Vote_CNP I think we would be ok. (California, Oregon, Washington) however thee other 47 states are gonna be in crisis.

34,"@vyxel_ Yeah it's firmly within the 80s, but It sounds like a line from the 1995 movie. I guess if we were 25 years younger we could probably understand it better. Lol"
35,@vyxel_ https://t.co/6FdDfi1JDt is it from apollo 13 or challenger? I find it enjoyable to play it on repeat and try to line up all of the events. Apparently semicharmed life is the newest thing in here but I can't hear it. Lol
36,@vyxel_ The next song excerpt in the compilation is So far away. üòÜ
37,"@vyxel_ The last one is from Apollo 13 the movie I think, but it might be regarding the spaceshuttle that exploded. There's not a lot of context."
38,@vyxel_ Maybe 1986...
39,@vyxel_ That's because it's a compilation. I believe this excerpt ranges from 1997 to 1990.
40,"@vyxel_ Nice, this one is harder but I think you might know it:
Anyway do you still live in angry days from A to Z if you wanna get with me you gotta god listen shuffled carefully his feet. Clearly I've never been there, but this feels like spread your wings and fly again the situation.."

57,"@david_kipping Very intriguing. There is a variable that is missing not mentioned in the episode. What if the transmitter broke, Arecibo style? 45 years is a long time to keep a machine operational. They could, build a new one, I guess. But in that case the signal would not be the same."

75,@vyxel_ Raising the atmospheric pressure would be nice so that we don't been a full spacesuit to go outside.
76,@vyxel_ And you are more correct than you realize. CO2 can be converted into rocket fuel. Lol
77,@vyxel_ 96% of Mars atmosphere is CO2. Some intelligent businessman on Mars will probably find a profitable way to convert CO2 into something else. Such as Methane. And we can copy that process on Earth to drop back below 400ppm.
78,"How do we reduce CO2 emissions? By building a city on Mars of course.
