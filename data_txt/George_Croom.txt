14,F*ck your thoughts and prayers because it‚Äôs empty. It means nothing. Over 100 people are killed every day in America at the end of a gun barrel. When I get into Congress I will ensure that some action happens on gun reform.
15,"It‚Äôs coming from the mouth of people that say women can‚Äôt legally and safely control their own bodies but will never seek to control the sale of deadly weapons.

I‚Äôm tired of decorum and civility in the face of blatant disregard for human lives and actual freedom."
16,"Believe me, nobody is manufacturing guns on the Southside of Chicago or in West Baltimore. 

During the same press conference they said there are no reforms that would have changed the outcome of yesterdays massacre."
17,They even took time out to tell Beto O‚ÄôRourke he was a son of a bitch. @govabbott made sure to enlighten us to the fact that Chicago has more gun deaths than Texas despite having tougher laws. He failed to say that they‚Äôre purchased in states like his where gun laws are relaxed.
18,@tedcruz even showed up. It‚Äôs odd that he now cares so much when he blocks gun reform legislation in the Senate. The same Ted Cruz that went on vacation when Texans didn‚Äôt have power during a devastating winter storm.
19,@govabbott sat at a press conference today and fed lip service about how distraught he is. Children died and they said we need to focus on moving forward as a country and providing hope. Hope must have been for their base. Hope that nothing will ever happen to reform gun laws.

21,I cried dropping my son off at school because I am afraid for his safety. Not just at school. I‚Äôm afraid on the way there. I‚Äôm afraid anytime I as a legal and responsible gun owner and not there to protect him from people that shouldn‚Äôt ever be able to own guns!

79,"What we need to remove now is the idea that Soviet era ideology is viable in the 21st century and beyond.

Sanctioning rich oligarchs only causes them to lose future money. It doesn‚Äôt make them less rich. It doesn‚Äôt stop Russia from running roughshod through the Ukraine."
80,"Let me be clear. I am not calling for regime change in Russia. Removing Putin from power would destabilize the world. His removal must be democratic. 

We should support free and fair elections in Russia supported by UN oversight. This will remove Putin."
81,In 1994 the US assured Ukraine protection when they gave up the Soviet nuclear stockpile they held. Where is their protection? Putin's decision to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine is illegal and cannot be tolerated by the world.
82,The US military has been shifting training and modernization efforts to prepare for threats from China and Russia for over a decade. American taxpayers have spent over $7 trillion to support this decade long build up. Money not used for schools or poor &amp; middle class families.
