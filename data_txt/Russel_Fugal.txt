25,This gives the political frame that debt forgiveness is earned. It also immediately affects inflation as budgets are adjusted to make as many student loan payments as possible. It also gets people outside the workforce to perhaps join in just to make student loan payments.
26,"First what, then Why.
Make restarting payments at this time optional (w/ carrot, not stick). Lessens the logistical burden. Open a window (e.g. 24 months) where regular monthly payments are tied to an up-to-100% loan forgiveness. I’m sure some wonk can come up the formula."
27,"A thorough discussion, but I have another idea on #StudentDebt that plays well both politically and economically.
1. Extend P&amp;I repayment freeze
2. At the same time, incentivize restarting payments with forgiveness. 
Why? https://t.co/QcRtpqLZOn"
28,We are at war. The least we could do is a wartime mobilization to stop consuming petro-state gas and oil by building out renewables like our lives depended on it; because they actually do. Shut down #NordStream asap; use the DPA to increase wind and solar power. Mobilize!
