2,@trevorweissman Just talk.
3,"Blatant PANDERING to the Dems. Today, Liz Cheney voted YES for Gun Control."
4,"Unlike Hageman, Liz Cheney NEVER fooled me. In 2014, when Cheney was preparing to run, she called me, as I was the Director of WY Gun Owners. I gave Cheney an earful for trying to convince me that she would move the ball for gun owners. I was right. https://t.co/GCjFzhJu7T"

15,The soft Lummis CNN interview on gun control? Lummis was too busy being bi-partisan and working with a NY Democrat to get a USELESS Crypto bill passed. Don’t be duped. The Marxists have Carte Blanche—because our side is weak!

27,"Oh the irony...McCarthy endorsement and fundraiser for Hageman, as well as an 'endorsement' from Elise Stefanik.
