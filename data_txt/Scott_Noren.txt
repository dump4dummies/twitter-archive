2,Now we don’t have to be Robert Deneiro or Sean Hannity to conceal carry in NYC. @JonScottFNC
3,@Mickey_Kearns What about the reciprocity for upstate in New York City for concealed carry question have you heard anything on that?
4,"@SquawkCNBC Until semi conductors are made here enmasse, until we create products not needing foreign rare earth materials, this market will be robo/computer traded capitulation. PERIOD."
5,RT @Noren4Congress: @sethmoulton Great! Now we law abiding citizens can protect ourselves from the illegal carrying gun touters. The triain…
6,@truthoh @sethmoulton why shouldn't CC be statewide..no reason....
7,@sethmoulton Great! Now we law abiding citizens can protect ourselves from the illegal carrying gun touters. The triaing requirement should be where they look to make things safer...it's haphazard currently.
8,@Jonesieman Right now if you are concealed carry Upstate you have to get an additional concealed carry permit for NYC..does the SCOTUS decision toss this restriction?

10,@CNYCentral Cornell needs to step up to the bat on this issue of American pulling out of the Ithaca airport. They also have a lot at steak and they have deep pockets and resources
11,"@FTC Henry Schein bought out Southern anesthesia and now southern merged with Ace Surgical. This is bad for surgeons like myself. Chairman Kahn, how is this merger allowed and deemed ‘good’?? Hope I spelled your name right!"
12,We're on the precipice of hopefully not having to listen to any Clinton again forever..hope eternal?
13,@CNYCentral @KathyHochul Is anyone seriously making the argument that legal concealed carry leads to mass shootings or significant gun violence? That’s ridiculous.
14,@MetLife You didn't escalate Jack ____ for me.. I'm turning this over to NYS Department of Financial Services if the check isn't cut today for our office.
15,@MetLife Twitter account of Metlife responded to email lip service..we'll get to your complaint...bs..if they don't get answers on reimbursement by the end of today for me as a provider I will turn it over to Dept of Financial Services NYS. Nov 2021 is when I did surgery...
16,@SecGranholm You can’t ramp up oil production when you have less refineries and there’s no immediate future of increasing the number of refineries  either. But then again you knew that.
17,@MetLife Performed surgery on a Metlife client 11/12/21 and still have not been fully paid. Considering pulling out as a provider. Going on for months and they outsource customer service and you get lip service most of the time instead of results. Doc
18,@CGasparino Just saw you and Tucker…wouldn’t made in the USA products and their expansion help the supply chain lower prices and not depend on expensive importing in China in particular?
19,"@elonmusk Instead of being distracted by Twitter acquisition, focus should be on battery raw materials not import dependent imho."
20,@SquawkCNBC How long is it gonna take everyone to figure out that raising rates isn’t going to fix made in the USA and supply chain problems contributing to inflation and get out of the import excesses.
21,@mmmmurf Would we have less inflation if we ramped up Made In USA products and pursued rapid decreases in dependence on foreign products? Also redesigning things like batteries so the raw materials needed are not rare earth imports??? Should have been done years ago.
22,@NPR Didn’t Stacey Abrams do the same thing as Trump’s in so many ways that she wouldn’t except the results of the election
23,@NPR Donald Trump should never be POTUS again; not all people at January 6th were violent and deserve massively differentiated adjudication; the video of the guy directly asking people to storm the Capital though he whispered‘peacefully’ which was meaningless since it wasn’t loud
24,@TuckerCarlson Unreported in ms media. Spectrum of activity. Some trespassing some let in by law enforcement some violent and some peaceful. If you enter the Capitol legally but refuse to leave that also could be trespassing. Talk about this spectrum please!
25,@SquawkCNBC Remember when Gillibrand claimed to be the author of the Stock Act? That’s when I turned that over to the Senate Ethics Committee. No slap on the wrist though for claiming Louise Slaughter’s Bill.
26,@SquawkCNBC Senator Gillibrand’s legislative meaningful success record for her entire time in Congress is negligible and speaks up every so often on issues but mainly spouts off on other members Bills.
27,@AFPhq Emily…we need more made in the USA to drop prices and mitigate supply chain issues

35,@AdamKinzinger I would like to dialogue about 5-10 minutes on an initiative to seriously reduce mass shootings and even smaller number shootings which is even more prevalent. Former Army and father of ANG son. Please PM me Congressman.
36,@SenatorDurbin I messaged FBI director Wray to have a dialogue on a major aid in averting mass shootings but it will take 5-10 minutes of your time to explain. Dr. Scott Noren. Let’s have a talk asap.
37,@DirectorWray Director Wray.. I’m an oral surgeon in Ithaca. I have a very unique additive solution for the mass shootings that are going on and I’m wondering whether you would be gracious enough to hear me out for 5 to 10 minutes sometime. I sincerely hope so. PM me for contact.
38,@davidaxelrod Congress can’t fix the mass shooting issue. Universal checks on public and private sales is a fraction of the solution. Are you amenable to hearing me out on  a unique solution that could help? PM me. Dr. Noren
39,"@tamarakeithNPR Dr. Scott Noren. Tamara..the key link to prevent most shootings by predominantly young males is the public, their social circles, work, school etc, red flagging them in a timely way to police. Yes, police. Ghost guns? Really? How many in mass shootings used? Zero."
40,@SamCroston1 Better protection by specially trained officers in grade schools and single entry guarded by those specially trained officers.
41,@SamCroston1 We need to develop a better network to law enforcement to report people with major signs of being unstable. It’s the best we can do.

46,@NPRinskeep There must be people in the circles of these shooters lives that know something isn't right.....
47,@GovKathyHochul The current laws in NYS regarding ownership and concealed carry are abhorrent. I was in touch with someone today that told me their personal situation and deserves for sure a 1 on 1 phone conversation between you and I. Trust me it's that important... if you care.
48,"@NYCMayor Wrong side on this one. If you are a law abiding concealed carry Ny'er on the subway and someone opens fire or on a platform, why should that person be a sitting duck if not allowed to CC. Criminals will get guns..we need to defend against them.https://t.co/ErF0ocdPrM"
49,"I feel hybrid non-recharge cars is the way to go, less drain on an eventual massive e-grid with blackouts.

50,"@BretBaier someone’s post: Our ancestors, like my grandparents, made their own baby formula. Instead  of telling people we're not capable of figuring this out, doctors could get on YouTube and teach caretakers how to safely sterilize equipment and share the appropriate recipe."
51,@hereandnow By the way the tops in Ithaca New York is closing in the downtown area which is a service to a lot of people of color so your news story about the buffalo jobs in New York is not unique whatsoever it’s happening all over just so you know
52,@jackspeer1 Isn’t it entirely possible that baby formula in the meantime could be homemade? I see many YouTube videos on just how to do that there’s got to be some people who have the means to buy the right ingredients and just do it themselves.
53,@ashishkjha Why are you not looking into nasal vaccines to PREVENT the spread of Covid? There are companies that need funding to accelerate the perfection of these and you could get mucosal immunity!!! Billions should be spent!!
54,"@SquawkCNBC Walmart imports 26% of its merchandise from China, UBS' Lasser estimated, while Target imports 34% of its products from China. We want made in USA esp with supply chain issues."
55,@SquawkCNBC CEO Target explains why they got crushed reporting today but you have to ask are they worth more than Walmart? No and Walmart owns more of their own products I believe. I see Target going lower.
56,"How about in 2024 we get two top notch candidates to choose from BOTH Parties...what's the likelihood of that? If you polled fairly, I bet you'd find most people would support that."
57,"@SafetyPinDaily I'm a Dem and yet I am not for a huge influx of illegal immigrants for resource, disease and fairness to those legally gaining citizenship. Labeling that racist is a way to shut people up. Stacking voters or the SCOTUS is not the way to uphold the Constitution. Legal is the way."
58,"Let's see what happens here. I feel you can be a Democrat or a Republican and be against massive illegal entry into our country. The latest tactic now is to cancel culture that and accuse you of being racist. No. It's about preventing disease (Covid), limited resources and rules."
59,@GLFOP @HARRISFAULKNER @JoeGamaldi Butv I still feel we the public must work more closely with law enforcement to weed out the lone wolfs and keep them from guns posession before they get a chance to act on impulses.

62,"@HARRISFAULKNER The real cure Harris...lone wolf shooters have some type of hints to friends, co-workers, classmates etc that something is wrong and that they shouldn't have access to firearms or should lose the priviledge if mentally unstable. Let's work harder at that."
63,"@RepKatiePorter Work hard to support the victims? Additionally, encourage people to turn in looney tune people like the shooter to law enforcement before they ever act out their misplaced anger."
64,"@andrewrsorkin finally… if a nasal vaccine is successful, immunization for kids would cause less need for distance learning and increase availability of parents to work freeing up labor shortage."
65,@andrewrsorkin Follow-up Andrew..here's a great article on the subject. I would love to come on and talk for 2 minutes on this: https://t.co/H55nc9i7rh
66,@andrewrsorkin Injectable vaccines are not going to be highly preventative whereas if they develop a nasal vaccine and it works this will be the game changer and you’re never going to talk about it because the money is in the injectable vaccine market
67,@ScottGottliebMD Youknow that nasal vaccines are the only way for preventative factors.

81,@michaelmina_lab so I feel like I have mucous plugs again which aggravates my asthma and I am several days post paxlovid. Is it likely to peeter out eventualy vs getting really sick again? Stressed.
82,"@kweintraub I saw your piece on nasal Covid vaccines, which I have been following for 2 years..Can't read yours yet because I'm not subscribed yet. This is the key to seriously blunting this pandemic and always has been. Even if a nasal vax became a booster it would be great."

86,@jaclynmdiaz My daughter was born at 24.5 weeks gestation and definitely had pain sensation...she had foot sticks for blood draws and retracted her foot in pain so I'm not sure where the 'medical experts' have ascertained no pain at 24.5 weeks. She's 26 years old now. Experts....
