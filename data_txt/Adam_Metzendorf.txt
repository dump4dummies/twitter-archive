While I wasn‚Äôt able to stay the whole time, it was beneficial to hear how candidates are planning to address our water issues from AG to Central Arizona Water Conservation Board. Excited to be part of the solution. #UpAndAdam2022 https://t.co/kaY2xEJrx9"

8,Thank you for your work @RepGregStanton #WeAreBG https://t.co/IouHparuAF
9,Had a great time this morning at the @MaricopaDems Summer Convention.  Proud to be there both as a  Congressional Candidate &amp; as a voting Precinct Committeeperson. S/o to all the staff for creating their ‚ÄúMCDPChella‚Äù with engaging speakers.  In ‚Äò22 change starts #BottomsUp https://t.co/YBlEGCvihw
10,One of the few issues @repdavid isn‚Äôt silent about is that he is anti-choice. What I think is lost on him is that his mother was able to make a decision that was right for her. Every woman deserves this same ability. #RoeVsWade https://t.co/oXHpDqPMh0
11,"To everyone out there hurting or feeling hopeless today, let‚Äôs turn anguish into action. I will do everything in my power to protect a woman‚Äôs right to choose.

13,"If you want to be part of that change, volunteer to speak to voters by knocking doors or participating in phone banks.  I will continue to show up anywhere and everywhere and convey how we can protect a woman‚Äôs right to have a safe and legal abortion."
14,"Educate 
People want to get involved but don‚Äôt know how or who to vote for. Change doesn‚Äôt come from street signs or TV ads.  It comes from peers explaining what‚Äôs at stake and how to change it."
15,I will make sure I continue to show up down ballot and when I am the nominee will allocate resources to the races. You can find out your legislative district here: https://t.co/EZpfEIb5ev
16,Maricopa County Attorney: @JulieGunnigle is the only Dem running and has already publicly stated she will not prosecute for any law that bans abortion.
17,"@AZLD2Dems - @JC4AZ for Senate &amp; @JudyForAZ for House 
@AZLD4Dems - @ChristinePMarsh for Senate &amp; @lauraforAZ  for House"
18,State Legislature: We are a NET gain of one Democrat in either State House or State Senate from blocking any bills that strip away the rights of women. Our Congressional District has two of the most competitive legislative districts in the state:
19,"Down Ballot Matters 
Here are the in-state races that protect your right to choose: 
Governor: any state law needs to get past the governor‚Äôs desk. 
Attorney General: this is the person that can choose to prosecute at the state level. @krismayes is the only Dem on the ballot."
20,"We need to try &amp; pass bills as they are written but if they can‚Äôt get through the Senate, a priority of mine is to find out what can pass and get that through. We must do something federally. 26 states are likely to ban or restrict abortion access. Inaction is unacceptable."
21,"Federally, perfect can‚Äôt be the enemy of the good
This was something often said by President Obama."
22,I‚Äôm done offering empathy and making heartfelt sentiments. I want to get things done.  Here is what I am going to immediately work to do as well as what I will do when elected if Congress can‚Äôt get this done first:
23,"She wasn‚Äôt looking for empathy, she wanted to know what we can do. Simply put, we can vote, we can donate, we can volunteer, and we can make our voices heard."
24,"I first learned about the Roe decision shortly before coffee w/ a constituent. Her sentiments were that even though we had the draft decision in May, today didn‚Äôt feel real. She told me that she doesn‚Äôt feel like America values women &amp; her concerns for her daughter."

37,"With @RepDavid exposed for who he actually is, if we have a Dem that comes from business (doesn‚Äôt hurt I used to work for the Suns), has an ability to hear discourse/perspective, and understands how to convey the right thing to do is also economically sensible, we will win! (5/5)"
38,Our district only has a 2% Republican lean. I have knocked on almost 3000 doors &amp; I speak with a lot Independents &amp; people that tell me they‚Äôre ‚ÄúGoldwater Republicans‚Äù. They tell me what happened to their party is unrecognizable but also don‚Äôt see a reason to vote Democrat. (4/5)

41,"As I have stated, one of the main reasons I decided to run for #AZ01 is because @RepDavid gets by with multiple ethics violations and constant no votes on good legislation because he stays silent. Silence is culpable. (1/5) https://t.co/gg9IS6c7mp"

72,Safe gun storage or ‚ÄúEthan‚Äôs Law‚Äù. According to the Secret Service &amp; Dept of Education in 76% of deadly school shootings the attacker obtained their weapon from their own home or that of a relative. Safe gun storage can largely prevent this  (4/4)
73,"Assault weapons ban. This 1994 law should be renewed and updated. The AR-15 has been used in the shootings in Uvalde, Buffalo, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and many more. This needs to stop and that starts with banning these kinds of weapons (3/4)"
74,Universal Background Checks and eliminate the gun show loophole. This would help prevent guns being purchased by people who are at higher risk to use guns to hurt themselves or others such as convicted felons or domestic abusers (2/4)
75,When it comes to common sense gun laws there are 3 main pieces of legislation I‚Äôll work to pass immediately which would mitigate some factors that have been the cause of these shootings. While it doesn't fix everything these would be significant steps in the right direction (1/4)
