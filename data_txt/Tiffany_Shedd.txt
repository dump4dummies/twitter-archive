77,"As AG I will use every ounce of influence to ensure Arizona‚Äôs legislature makes the border priority #1. Following Texas‚Äô successful plan, I‚Äôll email our legislators every 24 hours with what‚Äôs happening at our border. The reality is more terrible than the media will ever show."
78,"Our next AG will face a constant stream of lawsuits from radical open border activists, Washington D.C., &amp; Leftist lawyers against even our most common sense laws. They‚Äôve declared war on our state &amp; have disregarded our constitution. As AG I will take Arizona's state power back."
79,"We need to pursue the Cartels to the fullest extent of the law and use every tool we have to end this crisis‚Äîthe Governor acting as AZ‚Äôs commander in chief, the AG going after the Cartels as terrorist organizations, and our legislature dedicated to the task. AZ defending AZ."

87,"@POTUS, my family and I are our own security detail. Come down here without yours and tell me we don't have a border crisis."
88,"Trust me, this ""plan"" will do nothing but burden AZ's already struggling ranchers. Passing on the responsibility to citizens to patrol for the violent cartels is a slap in the face to every Arizona rancher whose already doing all they can to keep their farms and families alive. https://t.co/p9zPYwBHGZ"
89,Title 42 remains in place. It's a win - for now. But remember: Cartels still have operational control of the border. We still don't have a finished wall. And we're tying the hands of law enforcement. Lots left to do.
