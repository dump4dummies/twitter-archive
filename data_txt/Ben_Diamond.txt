While this is a significant loss for our community, I remain committed to ensuring their vision for this project becomes a reality."

My Democratic colleagues and I tried to improve the bill with reasonable amendments to protect our privacy rights. Sadly our efforts were unsuccessful."
67,"@ACLUFL @PPSENFL @PPSWCF HB5 should never have become law. I serve on the House Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with protecting Floridians’ constitutional rights – including our right to privacy. 

HB5 was never even heard in the Judiciary Committee."
68,"Glad to see @ACLUFL, @PPSENFL, @PPSWCF, and health care providers challenging HB5 – which explicitly violates Floridians' constitutional right to privacy.
