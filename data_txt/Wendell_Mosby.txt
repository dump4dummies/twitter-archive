11,@BET @NissanUSA BET hasn't been for the culture since Bob Johnson sold it to Viacom.
12,@ElieNYC Do you think African American children wouldn't fair better considering the current state of education?
13,@nwi Divisive Corner?!  You're showing your true colors NWI Times. How is supporting a woman's right to choice divisive? Those companies are stating facts about the recruiting top talent.
14,@JohnCornyn PLEASE DO US THE FAVOR! ✌🏾
15,THE SAME DAMN PEOPLE!!! P.S. Live God and Religion out of this political discussion. https://t.co/QS4BzkaH0y

21,@kathirrk303ride I'm still rolling with 2Pac...close 2nd though.
22,@RealGrug @BillNye The corporations had founders and they had children that eventually became heirs to those companies whether they sold their controlling interest or not.

37,@UnitedHealthGrp @UHC I recently switched over from @BCBSIL and the transition has been cumbersome and frustrating trying to get refills for a child with Type-1 Diabetes. 🤬
38,@HopeDealerCH @ClarkAtlanta That was putting it nicely. Dismantle the Department Of Education and create a 21st Century department.
39,@HopeDealerCH @ClarkAtlanta That was a very different time. The entire entire educational system needs to be blown up and reimagined. The standard for education should be set by how best our African American  learn.
40,"@jacobin @nightnurse38 I need all my money. Not some, not half."
41,"@teachergoals I worked at a Middle School to start 2021-22 but I left. Between horrible administrators, a limp union and testing, the current educational system  is flawed and doomed to continue failing our children. P.S. character schools aren't the silver bullet either..."
