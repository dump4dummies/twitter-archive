31,"The truth? Salud Carbajal did NOT secure $2.4B, but instead merely voted for a bill with heavy bipartisan support‚Äîwhich had been in the works for years prior to him taking office. Additionally, there are NO additional Blackhawk helicopters in CA to aid our firefighting efforts."

https://t.co/zFDbtEJmHG"
39,One of the problems with Washington is the number of people there with decades of political experience that put their own re-election AHEAD of the people in the communities they're supposed to serve. Where has that gotten us as a country &amp; how has that benefitted #CA24? It hasn‚Äôt
40,"As a small business owner, I know what it‚Äôs like to sign the front of a check, and I know what it takes to make a monthly payroll. As your Congressman, I'll put Central Coast families and small businesses first. I hope to earn your vote. #CA24

69,"@BradBradegg Thanks for your question. Unfortunately, the services he required are not offered at the community based outpatient clinic in Santa Maria. I‚Äôm certain we all agree that veterans need more access to services locally."
70,We need to have servant leadership that will bring forward new solutions to old problems. I'd be honored to represent the #CentralCoast in the United States Congress. #CA24
71,It‚Äôs a shame that obstructionist Democrats like @RepCarbajal are the reason why we don't have an ambassador in Saudi Arabia right now. #CA24
72,I think it was foolish of @RepCarbajal to be a supporter of the #IranDeal #CA24
73,"You can sponsor legislation, but having the leadership to actually get it to the floor is a different matter. @RepCarbajal has never been able to get a bill he's sponsored to the floor. #CA24"
74,"You say you won't criminalize innocent people, @RepCarbajal, but you have voted to tie the hands of law enforcement and to put innocent families and children here in danger. You will not speak out against people who commit crimes of violence against innocent women. #CA24"
75,"Grant money, @RepCarbajal? Our local law enforcement cannot take part in certain grants, like Operation Stonegarden that you've specifically referenced, because of the sanctuary state laws you support (but which you won't actually say you support). #CA24"
76,View @RepCarbajal's votes here at https://t.co/tHrQA1pQoa and choose for yourself who our representative should be. #CA24
77,"No, @RepCarbajal, the CUFF Act specifically exempted the type of scenario you referenced here - again, trying rhetoric instead of facts or results. #CA24"
78,The Sanctuary State policy is NOT about immigration - it's about law and order. My opposition to it is one reason so many local law enforcement organizations and the @BPUnion endorse me. #CA24
79,"Yes, we need comprehensive immigration reform, but we'll never get there when career politicians like @RepCarbajal play games. Of course he will not answer yes or no on his support of sanctuary state. Answer the question, Congressman. #CA24"
80,"It's not just country before party, @RepCarbajal - it's people before party, specifically Central Coast residents. You have voted to tie local law enforcement's hands when it comes to MS13, putting our people at risk. #CA24"
81,"A primary reason why I'm running for Congress is to put people first, before politicians. This is where there's a grave contrast between @RepCarbajal and myself - he's voted almost 100% of the time with his party bosses. #CA24"
82,Rep. Carbajal has unapologetically taken money from a man accused of molesting a teenage girl. That money needs to be returned without delay. #CA24
83,"Whenever @RepCarbajal voted against a common-sense, bipartisan bill, he calls it ""extreme"" to cover up his own partisanship. #CA24 #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform"
84,"Again, when a bill came to the floor making sure there was a legal bridge for our DREAMers and an expedited asylum process, @RepCarbajal voted against it - to curry favor with party bosses. #CA24"
85,"That's not what merit-based means, @RepCarbajal. #CA24"
86,Salud Carbajal has been silent on the murder of Marilyn Pharis - even in a specially-called SB County Supervisors meeting right after her death. He's on the wrong side of the badge when it comes to crimes against women. #CA24
87,"@RepCarbajal's votes have been on the wrong side of the badge for too long. My opponent has voted against numerous essential legislations, including Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act-- View the vote sheets here: https://t.co/gl5eQND3jD and https://t.co/DKYEzo4IRU"
88,#KatesLaw did nothing to punish human trafficking victims or asylum seekers. There is no amendment from Carbajal on record. #CA24
89,"While the Thomas Fire raged, @RepCarbajal voted against bringing the resolution to keep the government open to the floor -  gambling with our disaster relief. Trump and Pence didn't play games w/disaster relief, but he did. His words tonight are offensive. #CA24"
90,2 of 2: View those bills here: Resilient Federal Forests Act https://t.co/0mwcgwgcoc  and Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act https://t.co/VOg9RwCpWJ
91,"It's funny that Salud Carbajal brings up the Farm Bureau, since he has a 20% rating with that organization, which represents a huge sector of the Central Coast economy - agriculture. #CA24"
92,1 of 2: Management and mitigation is essential to avoiding catastrophic natural disasters like the Thomas Fire. @RepCarbajal has voted against two essential legislations to aide this effort...
93,"A compromise immigration reform bill, which provided for DACA reform, was voted against by my opponent - but all he can do is spout more rhetoric. Read the bill here #CA24 https://t.co/tES8l9vFsP"
94,"#TonyCardenas controls @BOLDPAC, which not from simply a PAC promoting diversity in Congress as @RepCarbajal The group is actively campaigning against at least one Hispanic incumbent. #CA24"
95,".@RepCarbajal, ultimately we have to stand up for what's right in this country. The right thing to do is to return the $20,000 you received from #TonyCardenas until trial for sexual molestation charges in 2019. #CA24"
96,"We need to have a balanced approach to renewable energy and a green energy future. I think it's a shame that @RepCarbajal pushed to close #DiabloCanyon without having a plan in place to replace jobs, revenue. #CA24"
97,I've made a promise to the voters of the Central Coast - no one will work harder than I will for our families. #CA24
98,#TeamFareed is looking forward to tonight‚Äôs live debate! Don‚Äôt miss out‚Äîtune in to @KEYTNC3 at 7PM to learn more about Justin‚Äôs campaign platform and why he‚Äôs the best choice to represent our families in Washington! #CA24 https://t.co/kjvzXz7A1f
