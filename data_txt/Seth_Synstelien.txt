Be vigilant, but love your neighbors, folks."
28,"14/16 The boogeyman isn't coming; it's already here. It's BEEN here, and I can assure you that it's not your neighbor. The real boogeyman is the consequence of letting our fear and mistrust get the best of us."
29,"13/16 If someone in politics says, ""there's a boogeyman coming...but with your money, we can stop them,"" they are most likely pulling your leg while trying to empty your wallet. 

How much did you pay to watch the movie, $29.99?"
30,"12/16 There's plenty to be angry about, so people like @DineshDSouza  and @RepMTG  need to stop fabricating stories that folks want to hear to make people scared of a boogeyman. Trying to rally people against whoever they point their finger at. 

""Be angry, but do not sin."""
31,"11/16 I think I need to remind everybody that Dinesh D'Souza was convicted of election-related fraud.‚Å∑ He's not known for his integrity, even if he's saying things that pander to hopes and beliefs."
32,"10/16 Also in case you didn't hear, GA's Election Board recently met, and a GBI investigator testified that with footage used in the movie they ID'd faces and license plates and tracked them down. The investigators found that it was a family member dropping off ballots legally.‚Å∂"
33,"9/16 By Mr. D'Souza's own admission in the film, they did not have footage of a single person visiting multiple dropboxes. Something that they claimed their data suggested."
34,"8/16 On top of all that, it was just bad data analysis. They didn't control and screen the geolocation data for public safety, delivery people, or people who worked in that area.‚Åµ That should be controlled at least in some part for any kind of accuracy."
35,7/16 The filmmakers said their data analysis was so good they helped solve a murder...for a case that had already gotten indictments two months before the filmmakers even claimed to influence the case.‚Å¥
36,"6/16 According to a spokesman from Mississippi State, the filmmakers also didn't use Mississippi State's High Performance Computing Collaboratory as they claimed either.¬≥"
37,5/16 This is a significant factor for the authenticity of claims made by the movie. The ACLED project states that Mr. D'Souza's claim is false.¬≥ He made it up. The filmmakers never even contacted ACLED.
38,"4/16 D'Souza claims the geolocation data tracking ""mules"" was supposedly validated by an overlap with information from the ACLED¬π (Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project) that tracks rioters and violent protestors."
39,"3/16 Besides the idea that there would have to be a pro-Democrat conspiracy amongst Republicans while we controlled the elections, there's a problem with the geolocation data the film used."
40,"2/16 Unfortunately, some are using the film ""2000 Mules"" by convicted fraudster Dinesh D'Souza as a gold standard of why we can't trust our local elections. You don't have to be a former cop and a published researcher (hi!) to see the problems with the ""evidence"" in this film:"
