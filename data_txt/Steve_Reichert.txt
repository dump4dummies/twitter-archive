0,"Given what’s going on in the world, why is the bulk of the FBI’s counter-terror resources currently focused on law-abiding Americans vs. sniffing out the long-term plants of our near-peer? Thank god for a few agents who never forgot their oath to the constitution!"
1,"The “science” has never changed, just their lies stopped working and the midterm elections are getting close!"
2,"If the proposed reconciliation budget gets passed, the IRS will be hiring 87,000 agents to harass and intimidate citizens across America! It will be easy for them, since ALL your transactions over $600 will be automatically reported to them. #FJB"
3,Only a dim lightbulb would use the term “nuclear capable” in a story. The most recent lightweight man-portable nukes can fit into a SMALL backpack… What’s next in the headlines “Chinese immigrant caught with nuclear capable backpack on bus” 🤦🏻‍♂️
4,"When assigning projects to those in your company… Always assign the smartest person on the team to work with the laziest person on the team. You will see some amazingly simple, yet ingenious results to the most complex problems."

6,"Would any West Coast Marines (active duty or reserve) like to attend the the funeral services of seven families of the 2/1  Marine killed in action? I’ll have 45💺 open on a private 737, departing MCAS Miramar 9.13 &amp; RTB 9.18. All hotels paid for."
7,"Biden’s handlers had a dilemma last night in the WH: P1..”Do we send him to Dover AFB, none of the folks there want him there. Or do we keep him in the basement” P2..”what would poll better”  P1..”fuck it send him and hope he doesn’t go near the parents much”"
8,@kenolin1 Nice photoshop job- that photo was taken in the White House- more liberal lies
9,Remember on Jan 5th &amp; 6th DHS and the FBI had thousands of agents all across the US doing “additional” screenings (checking tickets to match ID’s) on just about ALL flights to Washington DC. It’s as if they were making their arrest list already 🙄
10,The Cuban Government is suppressing internet access to their population. Why isn’t Biden using DOD to beam WiFi from space &amp; open cell signals from the Fl Keys? The🇺🇸could blanket Cuba with open access to the 🌎 .... yet the🍦eating Alzheimer's patient in the WH does nothing.
11,"Questions: What must one's body fat % be? Bench press/deadlift PR be? How often must one video their meals, &amp; what brand of spandex must one use before adding ""FIT"" into their IG username? LMAO asking for a friend. #DunkinDoughnutsMealPrep #Fit #SuperFit #ImSoSexy #Spandex #Flex"
12,"How 🇨🇳🇷🇺🇰🇵 will defeat the 🇺🇸military. They will show up to the battlefield without C19😷 &amp; shout wrong pronouns at our troops. 90% of DOD to💩their👖&amp; surrender. Once captured, these nations will torture our troops by playing the US National Anthem and reciting the Constitution"
13,Considering moving to Florida so I can file suit against the social media companies for blacklisting &amp; suppressing my reach. FB/IG only push my feeds to 0.06-1.8% of my followers.
14,"Remember when the tweets were mean, steel was half the current cost, and gas was a $1.50 a gallon? .....

Pepperidge Farm remembers! https://t.co/nssPAoNmtU"

16,"There have been several recent cyber-attacks against critical U.S. infrastructure. I wonder why only the Colonial hack made it into the news, yet none of the others?  Could it be that the folks in DHS/NSA tasked with preventing such occurrences in the industry are failing us all?"
17,"News flash: DHS's intelligence branch just launched a new group dedicated to domestic terrorism &amp; switched the focus of another office to focus on the same. This should be a concern for all Americans! I know some great senior guys in DHS, and they ALL are worried about this move."
18,"PSA: If your car is surrounded by cops, rifles pointing at your window... asking you to get out... and you decide to back down the driveway towards the cops... expect to get shot... IT’S YOUR fault for being retarded!"
19,"PSA: If an LEO stops you, be polite and comply with the officer(s). Doing so will prevent you from getting OC sprayed, tased, beat with ASPs, bitten by a K9, or shot! If you feel you were stopped/detained unjustly, take it up with the Department or Court AFTER. #DarwinAwards https://t.co/xRkj1GfB4r"

21,https://t.co/RUaIFBl8MY Sights set on SC-7 and Tom Rice’s seat. He was one of the 10 rinos who voted to impeach President Trump for his remarks on Jan 6nd. https://t.co/F4sDKHrZ0x
22,@ballotpedia Mission complete
23,"Acusations against @RepMattGaetz are BS. The corrupt FBI botches an investigation related to the extortion of Mr Gaetz, then the FBI leaks news of “other” investigations a few days later. 🤦🏻‍♂️ But don’t worry, the FBI isn’t a weaponized arm for the DNC. #AddAnother302toMyFile"
24,"@USSOCOM China, Iran, NK &amp; Russia are laughing at our SOF units now. Do you think our near-peers have diversity officers? News flash- THEY DON’T. They field the strongest warriors their countries have! Only in America will you find such liberal ass-clown jobs such as diversity officers..."
25,@USSOCOM @SebGorka
26,"Congrats to Tampa! They’ve solved all murders, found every missing child, stopped all drug &amp; human trafficking &amp; halted all gang violence. Since they have the time &amp; resources available, the Mayor has told the PD to review Superbowl video footage to issue fines to ""maskholes."""
27,How many times a day do you hear “for your safety” or “for the safety and in consideration of others” 😡 I prefer dangerous freedom 🇺🇸 vs. safe enslavement!  Any of you folks tired of the nanny-state mentality? https://t.co/mHeUlhR4x8

29,"So BLM &amp; ANTIFA can loot, burn and vandalize federal buildings, and assault police officers... all while not getting charged with any meaningful crimes. Then a few folks walk into the capital building and PRESTO, 25+ cases of “domestic terrorism” charges."
30,@ctlibertyjunky @antivistsdemand @bradybuzz @CSGV @Team_Enough @KrisB_Brown @JoshuaMHorwitz @staceyabrams 🤣☑️
31,@MyPrasong @bradybuzz @CSGV @Team_Enough @KrisB_Brown @JoshuaMHorwitz @staceyabrams Yup
32,"The FBI is being called upon to use all technological resources to ID those who were in the capital yesterday. Where were they when BLM/ANTIFA trashed, defaced and burned US Gov property all around DC? The re-weaponization of the FBI begins!"
33,@RichardGrenell In 1776 the redcoats said something similar.
34,"With all of our privacy rights trampled why was there no intel on a truck bomb on Xmas day in Nashville ? Once again, Sections 215 &amp; 702 prove useless to stop an attack, yet are used to go after President Trumps supporters for 4+ years now!"
35,"Where will $900 Billion come from? The Banks... where do the banks get it from? The Federal Reserve ... where does the fed get it from? They create it out of thin air, type it into a computer and presto! More fiat currency, and more US debt! #DevalueTheCurrency"
36,The latest relief bill passed by our elected leaders is a slap in the face of every American. What do you get for your past 9 months of trouble? $2.22 a day on average. That's what your elected representatives think you're worth. We need leaders with balls to do the right thing.
37,Perplexed at the news stories showing sheep lining up to get vaccinated like obedient serfs in front of the cameras. These remind me of old propaganda videos out of the USSR.   Wake up folks!
38,"Bidens plan to “save” us from the Hillary Flu- 1st: Re-classify what counts as a C19 death. Only deaths due strictly to C19 will be counted. 2nd: New cases re-classified. Only after 3 separate tests, all with + results will it be counted. Instant hero🤦🏻‍♂️"
39,STOP embracing tyranny. They’ve made people afraid in the name of “safety.” Look at people standing in lines. They go exactly to the X on the ground like a trained dog. STOP being sheep! If you're healthy and not susceptible to the flu (regular or Hillary type) - STOP the BS!
40,"Holiday season is inbound- that said... Support your local businesses! I hit a local gun store to get a part today. They know I can order it for what they pay, so instead of charging me $60 over cost, they hit me for $20 over. That simple gesture won all my future business!"
41,@RichHiggins_DC Time to jam mags

43,Has anyone else who has been shadow-banned on social media noticed a slight increase in engagement following the election? It’s as if they were suppressing certain people who didn’t agree with their political views🙄🤣
44,"What government agency do you think is the most corrupt and will be further weaponized should Beijing Biden get into office?

A) FBI
B) NSA
C) IRS
D) CIA
E) ALL OF THE ABOVE"

48,Dear Liberals: Tomorrow we celebrate a group of patriotic men who violently overthrew a tyrannical government to preserve individual freedom and liberty. If you’re offended by this please migrate to one of the socialist utopias you were trying to turn America into
