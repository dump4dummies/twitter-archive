Let’s keep Arizona’s 6th district RED - can you help me? 

https://t.co/Sk0m15FuWE https://t.co/aOMStNyHJA"
59,There’s a reason Hiral Tipirneni supports a “public option” for healthcare. Democrats call it the “glide path” to Medicare for All because its purpose is to make private insurance “die a drawn-out death.”
60,The Apple Watch came out in 2015. Hiral Tipirneni hasn’t been an ER doc since 2007. Who is @hiral4congress trying to fool? https://t.co/ki9beTgG4v
61,Even Hiral Tipirneni admitted she wasn’t an ER doc anymore. So why is she saying she's an ER doc again? @hiral4congress lying about your current job for votes isn't a good look. https://t.co/wn1KNPjkBt
62,"Hey @hiral4congress 2 years ago you got caught calling yourself an ER doc when you hadn’t been one in over 10 years. It's been 13 years now, yet you’re calling yourself an ER doc again. What changed other than the district you’re running in? https://t.co/9W0kJnu8oL"
63,"Now she’s running in AZ-06, a district she doesn’t live in and can’t even vote for herself in. It’s not surprising that Hiral Tipirneni supports massive tax hikes and dangerous border security policies for the voters of AZ-06: She doesn’t live here."
64,2 years ago @hiral4congress said “We get asked a lot ‘Why are you running in this race? Why are you in this district [AZ-08]? Why don’t you go to another district?’ And my answer is: This is my home. This is my district [AZ-08].” https://t.co/cSOHUBBULG
65,"""It’s disingenuous. Hiral [Tipirneni] wants voters to believe she’s something other than who she really is: a former physician sued for malpractice."" https://t.co/vCK0YI4kXq"
66,She called the tax cuts “horrendous” and “worrisome”. What’s really “worrisome” is that she wants to be your representative.
67,"$64 billion. In its first year, Republican Tax Cuts in 2017 saved Americans $64 billion dollars on their Federal income taxes. The average family saw their tax burden reduced by over $2,000 dollars. You’d think Americans everywhere would be proud. Not Hiral Tipirneni."
68,"Hiral Tipirneni is just too liberal for Arizona. Not only does she want to expand Obamacare, she wants to put us on a path for Medicare for All. And she wants to pay for it all by raising YOUR taxes. https://t.co/cKbOklHTbn"
69,"Is anyone surprised that Elizabeth Warren endorsed Hiral Tipirneni? Both want to nationalize healthcare, raise your taxes, and ban guns. Hiral Tipirneni isn’t just liberal, she’s radically liberal. 
https://t.co/MwOWgEd3BN"
70,The last thing we need is more taxes @hiral4congress.
71,"With comments like calling tax cuts “horrendous” it’s not surprising that Hiral Tipirneni opposes tax relief for Arizona families and small businesses. In fact, it’s clear that she would raise both the federal and state income taxes as well as our payroll taxes. https://t.co/HP0c913c2D"
