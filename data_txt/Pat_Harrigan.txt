16,"Under President Biden, our country doesn't have a border. In the Special Forces, my first and last task of the day was always to ensure perimeter security. Let‚Äôs come together as Americans to make our own security more than a pithy soundbite."
17,"Conservative Veterans are the key to bringing our country back from the Democratic party‚Äôs failures. We know what it's like to put America first, and we'll NEVER stop fighting to keep our citizens free and safe. Retweet if you agree! #NCpol"
18,"Instead of securing our borders, Biden has turned a blind eye to the safety of our communities and is literally incentivizing illegal immigration. It's time to build the wall, secure our borders, and outlaw sanctuary cities. Join me at https://t.co/X7IwaHiKzd #ncpol https://t.co/7mK2u3lXEM"

24,"I‚Äôm not the only one who is frustrated that gas and milk are nearly $4 a gallon. The Democrats need to stop devaluing the dollar by curbing inflation, cutting wasteful spending, decreasing taxes, and lowering energy prices. It‚Äôs so simple and this Republican will do it!"
