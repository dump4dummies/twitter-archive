3,"Here’s to the next chapter. @RepSpeier ascended to Congress in 2008 after Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) died while in office. Now Speier says, after nearly 4 decades in government, it is time to go home."
4,Thank you @SenatorLeahy for graciously putting down the gavel and passing the torch. “The next generation will ensure our democracy remains whole and thriving.” You said it.

16,"If America is ready to begin reopening, should we start reallocating our resources to programs like childcare to help folks get back to work?
https://t.co/iNqupJh3zD"
17,"@RonWyden If you believe the solution is ""expanding access to resources like child care"" does that mean that you agree it is time to end pandemic unemployment benefits, but don't have the courage to say so and are yourself scapegoating South Carolina and Montana?"
18,"@RonWyden Maybe... if you spent less time tweeting about the excellent turkey cheesesteak hoagie you ate for lunch, you could spend more time focusing on the economy, Mr. Senate Finance Committee Chair. Anyway, what's more important: Gender Equality in the Workplace or Your Sandwich?"
19,"@RonWyden ""Accelerating our economic recovery"" said the Congressman.
https://t.co/3uiFK98gkU https://t.co/H9VPmUWuWO"
20,@RonWyden @FCC Has Wyden pushed for this program to close the digital divide or to deposit gross amounts of tax treasure into the bank accounts of “approved providers”? A.K.A. the dark money donors behind his reelection campaign.
21,"@RonWyden @Verde_NW Sometimes, fresh leadership is all Oregon needs to transition decades of trash back to functional environments."

23,"Greater challenges are looming, and the U.S. needs a new strategy. So why the resistance? Member of Congress protect the status quo. To overcome this inertia, new leadership must develop new concepts of operations for deterring and defeating aggression.
https://t.co/mdvxX3cHDo"
24,"@RonWyden A quick stop to grab a tasty lunch and You just happened to have photographer to document it? Well anyways, thanks for pushing pause on your reelection campaigning during the time period ordinary Oregonians are stuck living under extreme risk orders, NOT!"
25,"Thanks @SenJeffMerkley and @SenatorRomney for coordinating a bipartisan assessment of interconnected ecosystems. 
https://t.co/rIy6Hcvh5w"
26,"@RonWyden Really, you are eager to hear from Eastern Oregon. It looks Morrow, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa &amp; Wasco counties have sent to you an easily audible message but you simply are not listening to them. https://t.co/q3LBROFdNA"
27,"@RonWyden @RepBonamici @repblumenauer @familyforward @APANONews Portland and many other Oregon cities got moved to “extreme risk” following Senator Wyden's early April tour. This surge of COVID cases will be known as the #WydenWave. Public health should take priority over Wyden’s rallies, even if he coins them “townhalls”."
28,"During the first 7 months of the pandemic, there were 26% more ER visits for suicide attempts, compared with 2019. 1 of the 4 problems that has intensified the system’s problems is “the effectiveness of existing federal law requiring coverage parity”. 
https://t.co/N1IwpPQqeH"
29,@RonWyden “Our health care system is failing Americans” said the congressman who has held office since 1981.
30,America’s communication networks are under an ever-growing threat of being damaged by natural disasters related to climate change. The FCC should establish guidelines that will minimize outages and ensure that critical infrastructure is resilient and energy efficient.
31,"COVID, Vaccines, Economy, Reopening, Health Care, Immigration, Foreign Policy, Climate, Social Justice... There will be a lot to recap tonight. https://t.co/gONFc5Yr6B"

33,"@RonWyden The biography of Senate Finance Committee Chair: Ron Wyden, reads he has “author[ed] more than 150 bipartisan bills &amp; assembled unprecedented bipartisan coalitions”. Profiling of all kinds is simply shameful, an overt attempt to suppress dissenting views, and an abuse of power."
34,@RonWyden @SenWarren “Badly broken” said the congressman who has held office since 1981.
35,"@RonWyden @SenateFinance Finance Committee Chair - 2014 and Present.

NO committee hearing on the climate since 2009.

Q: What happens under the leadership of Senator Wyden?

A: Stonewalling?"
36,"RT @allontheline: ✨ Happy Apportionment Day ✨

37,"@SenateFinance @RonWyden Given, the biography of Ron Wyden, Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, reads that he has “author[ed] more than 150 bipartisan bills and assembled unprecedented bipartisan coalitions”, we already know who is responsible for those decades of tax code."
38,@amyklobuchar Mentors become immortal when their protégé perpetually encourage new generations of leaders.
39,@RonWyden Performing acts of kindness will perfect America and the world.
40,"RT @OregonGovBrown: It's an exciting day for Oregon. Now, everyone 16 years and older is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Make your…"
41,"@RonWyden The biography of Ron Wyden, Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, reads that he has “author[ed] more than 150 bipartisan bills and assembled unprecedented bipartisan coalitions”. Senator Wyden has played Washington politics for 40 years and is continuing the drama today."
42,@RonWyden Do you respond to a U.S. Congressman who has held office for 40 years yet only complains about the systems that govern our country or just vote for fresh leadership in the next election and fix the problem? America is long overdue for a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. Senate.
43,"@SenJeffMerkley Every American should have high-quality, affordable health care. The #ChooseMedicare Act could be a key steppingstone to get Medicare for All. https://t.co/DN5B4DmY3M"
44,"@RonWyden After 40 years, U.S. Congressman Wyden has become so complacent with the status quo, Oregon literally started on fire before he realized the threat WE are living with. Not the senator however, He only took a few breaths from last year's smoke-filled sky before flying home."
45,"@RonWyden Ironic that the Senator embeds a digital news article requiring a subscription to the “Washington Post” to read. Apparently, he is fine with soliciting patronage of for-profit businesses he has a relationship with but not “unfriendly” ones i.e. those who don’t give him anything."
46,"@RonWyden About a week ago you were messaging about the Civilian Conservation Corps, now The Military Draft. Do you know the time, place and relevant events? If you are going to extend your 40 year term in congress you must remain mentally alert."
47,"@SenWarren The biography of the Senate Finance Committee Chair: Ron Wyden, reads that he has “author[ed] more than 150 bipartisan bills and assembled unprecedented bipartisan coalitions”. The idea of “Stop-and-frisk tax audits” sounds like a way to suppress dissent. https://t.co/VBUZi6wi6M"
48,"@RonWyden Senator Wyden, a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, failed to recognize a security threat. His indication that he is learning about this threat at the same time documents are being unclassified is simply an attempt to cover-up his dereliction of duty."
49,@RonWyden Most Americans knew well before this last year that the problems cited by the congressman existed. This tweet only reveals that while serving as the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee he has become so insulated from the realities of the 99% that he just figured it out.
50,"@RonWyden This image of Greater Idaho was posted by “The Oregonian” on April 12, 2021. Does it = a great sign of ongoing progress? https://t.co/2nGDlEZnwn"
51,"@RonWyden @SecFudge This is a symptom of the dysfunction lifelong congressional incumbents have caused. If the legislative branch would work for all people, America would not be disadvantaged by swings in critical rules from one side of the aisle to the other as ink flows onto executive orders. https://t.co/tgzINMVrK5"
52,"@Oregonian With distribution of J&amp;J vaccinations halted, this is an especially grim glance of Oregon following the statewide #2021townhall campaign tour of @RonWyden. His recent insistence on holding in person events in most Oregon counties has resulted in a #WydenWave of COVID infections."
53,@RonWyden @POTUS The withdrawal of Ron Wyden from the U.S. Congress is long overdue. His withdrawal would finally give the next generation a seat at the table of American democracy. Will Ron follow the lead of 6 out of 7 presidents elected during his tenure or stand tall with the other? https://t.co/f3NQSczdSj
54,"Here is what 40+ years of U.S. Congressman Ron Wyden’s policies look like. This image was posted by “The Oregonian” on April 12, 2021. https://t.co/AoE8Ji9x7g"
55,"@RonWyden The biography of Senate Finance Committee Chair: Ron Wyden reads, that he has “author[ed] more than 150 bipartisan bills and assembled unprecedented bipartisan coalitions”. His current tweet is simply divisive rhetoric used to promote his own hegemony. https://t.co/Ardwgnyx0r"
56,"@dbhaun @BillClinton David, That is an interesting bit of trivia that had escaped my base of knowledge."
57,"@RonWyden I was sad to read that at 74, Jack Hanna has been diagnosed with dementia and that his condition has progressed so rapidly that he is no longer able to participate in public life. I respect his family's request for privacy since his health rapidly deteriorated to a fragile state."
58,"@DNCWarRoom @maddow @POTUS As a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from the State of Oregon in 2022, I am appalled by the suggestion that incumbents are buying votes. This billboard campaign is specifically designed to disenfranchise qualified participants from opposing lifelong incumbents. https://t.co/crOQBKvz4d"
59,"@ORDems @JoeBiden @RonWyden @JeffMerkley @TheDemocrats As a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2022, I am appalled by the suggestion that incumbents are buying the votes of the Oregon electorate.

61,"@RonWyden @GPJOChamber Despite @OregonGovBrown increasing COVID risk levels the Senator continues his campaign tour, in Albany, Chiloquin, Deschutes County, Eugene, Grants Pass, Hood River, Jefferson County, Klamath Falls, Lincoln County, Newport, Tillamook County and Tumalo Creek. Stop the #WydenWave"
62,@RonWyden Necessity is the mother of ingenuity. I am saddened that the lack of comprehensive federal response to COVID forced individual communities to resort to converting old car repair shops into health care sites. U.S. Senators should be ashamed of neglecting Americas COVID needs.
63,We should not only make it easier for eligible voters to vote but also for eligible candidates to appear on a general election ballot. Oregon’s closed major party primary system is specifically designed to disenfranchise qualified participants from opposing lifelong incumbents.
64,@RonWyden @fema I heard wood prices are up around 181% and housing prices are skyrocketing because decades of timber mismanagement on federal lands has resulted in what @RonWyden called “hazardous fuels” and catastrophic loss. U.S. Congressman Ron Wyden 1981 – Present.
65,"@RonWyden Since April 1, 2021 Ron Wyden has tweeted photos of himself with crowds in Albany, Chiloquin, Deschutes County, Eugene, Hood River, Jefferson County, Klamath Falls, Lincoln County, Medford, Newport, Tillamook County and Tumalo Creek. Was La Clinica just exposed to the #WydenWave?"
66,"Since April 1, 2021 @RonWyden has tweeted photos of himself with crowds in Albany, Chiloquin, Deschutes County, Eugene, Hood River, Jefferson County, Klamath Falls, Lincoln County, Newport, Tillamook County and Tumalo Creek. Is Oregon entering the #WydenWave?"
67,@OregonGovBrown We should also make it easier for eligible voters to vote for eligible candidates in a general election. Oregon’s closed major party primary system is specifically designed to disenfranchise qualified participants from opposing lifelong incumbents. https://t.co/NevLB6VSUC
68,@SenJeffMerkley Oregon holds closed primary elections.  What will #ForThePeople Act do to prevent the establishment of a major political party that holds a registered majority from railroading the nomination of lifelong incumbents? Democracy will benefit when we can all participate.
69,"@OregonGovBrown @OHAOregon Since April 1, 2021 U.S. Senator Wyden has tweeted photos of himself with crowds in Albany, Chiloquin, Deschutes County, Eugene, Hood River, Jefferson County, Klamath Falls, Lincoln County, Newport, Tillamook County and Tumalo Creek. Is Oregon entering the #WydenWave?"
70,"@SenatorLujan But will it stop lifelong incumbents from railroading their own major party primary nomination from one election cycle to the next, and the next, and the next... https://t.co/RfHbdYKvs7"
71,@RonWyden What are you talking about? Thriving = Vigorously Prospering or Flourishing. In March of 2021 Gov. Brown's executive order 21-07 declared a drought emergency in Klamath County and directed state agencies to coordinate and prioritize assistance to the region. Tell the truth.
72,"@SenSherrodBrown @RonWyden @MarkWarner Here’s a thought: 

Let’s stop re-electing politicians who have spent their career creating the policies that pushed corporations to ship American jobs overseas to begin with.

74,@SenJeffMerkley What will the #ForThePeople Act do to end the demagoguery that has turned the U.S. Congress into a 40-year to life-long commission? https://t.co/Y7Nw66uZWU
75,"@RonWyden @thebulletin @PeoplesTH Democracy benefits when everyone shares a stake in its success, but Senator Wyden has usurped the voice of Oregon voters for the past 40 years. It is past the time that he respect the spirt of his six-year term and return autonomy to the Oregon electorate."
76,"@RonWyden @RepJoeNeguse FDR provides to us a perfect lesson. His predecessor, Hoover, was not the right person to meet the needs of America. Luckily, FDR came along with fresh ideas. Similarly, incumbents content with reviving a nearly 90-year-old program may not be the right people to lead tomorrow."
77,@RonWyden Oregon’s youth will be responsible for keeping Oregon a beautiful place where democracy can happen. We need politicians who understand this and who are comfortable getting out of the way so that the next generation can take the seat that they are sitting in.
78,@SharonG @RonWyden @KWSO An amusing way to point out hypocrisy. Do virtual events need to take place from the same location that an analogous live event would happen? Are COVID cases raising? Should politicians use the mask of incumbent activity to advance their own hegemony?
79,@RonWyden The share of workers covered by collectively bargained work contract has fallen every decade since the year you and President Ronald Regan were elected. Now you are proposing that mega-corporations create good-paying jobs. Enlighten us.
80,"@RonWyden @KWSO Why is Senator Wyden talking about broadband when he obviously doesn't understand how the internet works? 

Senator Wyden, 
Traversing the state to hold “online virtual events” in the town you're campaigning in is not necessary. You are causing a #WydenWave of new COVID cases."
81,"@RonWyden @SenateFinance The same old rhetoric and same old promise from the same old Senator.
- Congressman Ron Wyden – 1981 to Present.
- Finance Committee Chair - 2014 and Present. 
- Skyrocketing inequality – The day he got elected to 
  Present."
82,@RonWyden @PeoplesTH Democracy benefits when everyone shares a stake in its success but Senator Wyden has usurped the voice of Oregon voters for the past 40 years. It's past time that he respect the spirt of his six-year term and return autonomy to the Oregon electorate. He must end his 40–life term.
83,@RonWyden @dhnews Democracy benefits when everyone shares a stake in its success but Senator Wyden has usurped the voice of Oregon voters for the past 40 years. It's past time that he respect the spirt of his six-year term and return autonomy to the Oregon electorate. He must end his 40–life term.
84,"@RonWyden If you truly care about the health of Americans, why have you spent the week gathering with so many different groups around Oregon? Do you not know COVID cases are on rise again or do you just value creating campaign propaganda more then the health of Oregonians? #WydenWave"
85,"@RonWyden As COVID cases rise in Oregon yet again, you have spent the week gathering together many groups of people for photo opportunities. Why do you insist on placing a higher value on creating campaign propaganda then on the health of Oregonians? #WydenWave"
86,@RonWyden @NWYouthCorps @RepJoeNeguse The congressman who has been in office since 1981 just announced he had to piggyback on one of the youngest members of congress in order to get American youth to clean up the hazardous fuels that accumulated during his 40 years in office.
87,"@RonWyden @kidsports4life @OregonWBB It takes a village. When room is made for all citizens to participate, opportunity becomes limitless and communities thrive."
88,@SenJeffMerkley Are you suggesting that income inequality has something to do with national policy and that it would be fair for Americans to hold accountable long standing members of congress for 40 years worth of misguided leadership by voting against them in 2022? https://t.co/C0XI0eZw79
89,@RonWyden “It is standard in fascist politics for harsh criticisms of an independent judiciary to occur... critiques are then used to replace independent judges with ones who will cynically employ the law as a means to protect the interest of the ruling party”. -Jason Stanley
90,"@RonWyden The generation who will be responsible for developing and funding a once-in-a-generation investment deserve a seat at the table when allocation of resources are made. Much like the infrastructure of 1981, congressmen from the same year are crumbling. Rebuild the U.S. Senate."
91,@RonWyden @BendChamber America is mourning because the lack of cohesive federal response allowed COVID-19 to burden way too many of us for far too long. Now you are burdening the next generation of Americans by taking out loans to buy your re-election in 2022. Do you know no shame?
92,@AOC According to https://t.co/YgtPQLWWhu Seattle’s minimum wage for employers with 501 or more employees is $16.69/hour. Why is Amazon bragging about a starting pay rate that is below the minimum required by their headquartered city?
93,@RonWyden Haleigh is an example of the excellence that results when confident leaders make room for the next generation. Congressmen who hold office for 40 years-life measure their own success by their ability to repress others. Those politicians are a barrier to true Oregon excellence.
94,@RonWyden @FCC Expansion of broadband is already a priority of the BIDEN administration. You are trying wear a mask of incumbent activity to advance your own hegemony and are simply setting the stage to make a false claim of legislative victory in your 2022 campaign.
95,"@OPB From 1981-2021 mass shooting have sharply increased. During that time both major parties have held a majority. What has not changed is this U.S. Congressman, he has failed to create a culture that respects life. VOTE Him OUT! https://t.co/senlve6DSz"
96,@RonWyden https://t.co/cInnqBIGKc
97,@RonWyden @BobsRedMill Democracy benefits when everyone shares a stake in its success. It is vital that incumbent leaders respect the spirt of their offices term and provide opportunity for others to become involved in the decision making of their government. We must end 40 year - life long terms.
98,"@RonWyden The voice of Oregon voters has been filtered through Senator Wyden for 40 years. For the people to be the rulers, there must be genuine individual deliberation. Compelling the Oregon electorate to speak through himself produces only the appearance of autonomy."
99,"@RonWyden When you use the mask of incumbent activity to advance your own hegemony, you are using it to dissuade opponents."
