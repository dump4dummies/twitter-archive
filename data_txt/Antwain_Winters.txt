1,"@openyoureyes76 @IlhanMN If that’s true, he can sue the coach for violating his 1st amendment rights. It’s really that simple."
2,"@jmc_80 @DinahRN @NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the exercise thereof."
3,@jmc_80 @DinahRN @NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast The ruling Reaffirmed the first amendment. Which also protects you against such things. Where in the ruling does it say the first amendment is null?
4,@IlhanMN Where in the ruling does it state that teachers can retaliate against students? Receipt please.
5,@DinahRN @NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast And I have witnessed my children being led in meditation by their teacher.
6,@DinahRN @NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast They’re on a slippery slope. Seeing how many religions there are.

10,@NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast Just like people saying that our rights to privacy we’re annulled with Roe. They weren’t. The ruling was that the right to privacy doesn’t apply when it comes to abortion.
11,"@NoLieWithBTC @thedailybeast It doesn’t say students will be forced to pray. It doesn’t say that Christianity has been made a national religion. It says people have a 1st amendment right, and that right includes prayer. Hyperbolic statements are very dangerous."
12,"@_realJAG @MsMackAnomaly He left the door open to outlaw sodomy and gay marriage, in his concurrent statement. That’s why they’re angry at him. No excuse though."
