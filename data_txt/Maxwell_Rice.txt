16,@BillKristol @Timodc @Timodc supports a carbon tax? I‚Äôm so glad Neo cons got flushed out of National Political discourse and power.
17,@CathieDWood Doesn‚Äôt the amount of Electricity wasted in PoW trump any liberal arts college debate like this? PoS is the only possible viable option if Crypto were to actually be a currency and not dungeons and dragons on a shared spreadsheet.
18,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 If you read the snakes side of Genesis, the snake was just telling Eve she needed more fruit in her diet. The 2 million wasn‚Äôt raised because of Lin Wood. It was given by people who wanted to bail Rittenhouse. They already got their attorney fees. üêÉüí© if Wood sues A 17 year old"
19,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 If you read the snakes side of Genesi, the snake was just telling Eve she needed more fruit in her diet. The 2 million wasn‚Äôt raised because of Lin Wood. üêÉüí© if he sues 17 year old he kept in jail."
20,@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 The facts are Lin Woods campaigned for bail money and attorneys fees after they hit their target. He is now fighting to get 2 million dollars from a 17 year old. I can‚Äôt tell if you are being genuine or have ties to Lin Wood.
21,@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 You support Lin Wood after he supported John Kasich for president in 2016 and voted in the Georgia DEMOCRAT primary in 2018 (while Trump was president)? I would love to see proof I‚Äôm wrong beyond (‚ÄúTrust Lin Wood‚Äôs word on telegram‚Äù)
22,@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 Lin gave Rittenhouse advice (give Washington post interview) that hurt both Civil + Criminal cases. He also fundraised to bail Rittenhouse out for 2 months. If Wood had ‚Äúnothing to do with it‚Äù then why is he seeking the 2 mil? And how long did woods sit on the 2 mil before bail?
23,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 Do you, like Lin Wood, think the Tucker Carlson interview was a ‚Äúset up‚Äù? And at same time thought your 17 year old client giving a Washington post interview pre trial was a good idea? Lin Wood is an agent provocateur"
24,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 How long after receiving 2 million did Lin Wood wait to bail out 17 year old from county jail (who had target on back from msm coverage from county jail)? Considering they collected attorney fees, why is Lin Wood going after the 2 million bail from a 17 year old?"
25,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 Also, How do you defend Lin Wood's advice to Rittenhouse to give interviews with Washington Post? Or Lin Wood endorsing John Kasich in 2016, voting georgia democrat 2018, and voting by mail 2020? #LinWood #DoesntMakeSense"
26,"@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 Slimy Lin Wood raised 2 million for bail and 300k for attorneys fees. They had full bail money, but kept Rittenhouse in jail to raise more.... Now they are trying get the 17 year old to give them 2 million dollars... What does that say about you defending the lawyer?"
27,@ChiefsWO @greg_price11 Lin Wood endorsed John Kasich in 2016. Voted in Georgia Democrat primary 2018. Voted by mail 2020..... Lin Wood is üêÉüí©. The evidence is public knowledge Lin Wood has bail money in September. No need to go to telegram.
28,@bennettpeer @RobertBilott @USRightToKnow @DarkWatersMovie @DevilWeKnowFilm @rightlivelihood 100%. EPA also needs to do the right thing and act no. We shouldn‚Äôt have to wait until 2023 for them to unveil road map.

40,@AnonymAditya @HKrassenstein @TiffanyATrump @willsommer @coffeebreak_YT I think E-Coins is scam of century. And bit clout is one of the most blatant versions.
41,"@HKrassenstein @TiffanyATrump @willsommer @coffeebreak_YT What is bitclout backed by? Investments and currencies are backed by some sort of underlying asset, military  or resource."
42,@HKrassenstein @TiffanyATrump @willsommer And I‚Äôd be happy if I‚Äôm wrong! Please let me know if anything in @coffeebreak_YT Video is inaccurate. https://t.co/su4FHkDSRG
43,@HKrassenstein @TiffanyATrump @willsommer Bit clout is a Ponzi scheme inside of a Ponzi scheme. Real shame for one to make money off of people‚Äôs hopes/misunderstanding of crypto.
