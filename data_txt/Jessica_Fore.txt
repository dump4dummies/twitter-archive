14,"@KyleBartleson I mean, we can hope that they fumble it.  We're very vulnerable as a nation to them succeeding, and it's a setup for 2024.  We are in an incredibly dangerous spot right now, with significant numbers of folks that are STILL ""Yay MAGA, what's the big deal libtards."""
15,"@KyleBartleson Yeah, Greitens belongs in a batterer intervention program, not ANY position of public trust under any circumstances, EVER."
16,"@SollenbergerRC It's no mystery that pathological abusers are drawn to MAGA. Abuse is rooted in power and coercive control. So is Trumpism. It's not about any particular political principle; it's about domination and cruelty for sport. All of us, conservative or liberal, must oppose these guys."

46,"@BlakeAued @NerdAthens Correct. Hatcher's campaign has the legal right to request a recount. However, the SOS did not notify my campaign at all. We heard through the grapevine.

52,"@KyleBartleson @BeeForGeorgia Fair question, and I'm still too much of a campaign finance noob to draw an informed distinction.

57,"@theAcerbicMonk @JeridEvan For me, it raises the question of what his victims would have been put through if he had jumped through the hoops and said ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù My guess is they become the problem if they don‚Äôt buy it. BTW these are just 2 cases at FPC that got press! There are others."

64,@JesterWootton @vhobbs5 They've allocated all of 45 minutes to the abuse report on the docket.  9:30-10:15 a.m. on June 22nd.  45 minutes.  That's nothing.

67,"@JesterWootton @vhobbs5 Oh but there is a PCA though, and it determines whether people have jobs.  That's the crux of the matter. Guys who want to see abuse addressed also want to be hired for good $$ and a housing allowance, and PCA calls are what their cvs now support because they did RUF in college."
68,"@JesterWootton @vhobbs5 Essentially, the committee was tasked with making a report that's acceptably toothless toward all the covert abusers and enablers who are elders in the PCA, with no review by PCA victims. Don't name names and keep calling them all ""Fathers and Brothers."""
69,"@JesterWootton @vhobbs5 That being the case, I'm concerned that having all these credible folks involved with the committee &amp; making a noncommittal milquetoast report aids all the evil dudebros in being like ""Look! The PCA cares about abuse! We did a thing! YOU'RE not abused though- YOU'RE the problem!"""
70,"@JesterWootton @vhobbs5 Their hands ARE tied. I have no doubt of excellent intentions by the committee members, but the PCA is never going to allow anything that ACTUALLY addresses abuse, just pontification about ostensibly being against it. I'm often reminded of this:  https://t.co/SUS2lmvcXr #pcatoo"

78,"@KyleBartleson And to be fair, this is also mainstream Democratic doctrine (mostly.)  Biden and the old guard are center right classical conservatives, economically/academically speaking. If you want the government to make life more affordable for working people, elect progressives. :)"
79,"@KyleBartleson Biden has no control over gas prices unless he intervenes in the marketplace. GOP doctrine is leave the market alone &amp; let corporations charge whatever the market will bear &amp; it's not the fed gov't's role to regulate it. Until filling my F350 gets expensive, then blame Dems. :)"
80,@KyleBartleson U.S. refining capacity is the same level now as in 2014. 17.4M barrels per calendar day.  A barrel of crude is the same as in 2014. $110.  A gallon of gas was $3.60 in 2014.  It's $4.69 now.  It's not a scarcity issue.  It's deliberate price gouging for higher profit margins.
81,@KyleBartleson The $ per barrel demonstrates scarcity isn't the issue. It's gouging. The $ per gallon is up disproportionately to the price per barrel of crude. It's both a real cost increase and an excuse to raise prices on everything else. Execs are laughing about it on earnings calls.
82,Crude oil was over $180/barrel in 2008.  A gallon of gas was $4.11.  It was $110/barrel in 2014.  A gallon of gas was $3.60.  It is now $110/barrel.  A gallon of gas is $4.69.  This isn't inflation; it's price gouging.

Before 2A, the Constitution provides the right to LIFE. Your bonkers desire for violent people to have guns is subordinate to kids not getting shot. Grow up."
86,"@VernonForGA @BetoORourke Gun sales increase when there‚Äôs a mass shooting. Gun companies give $ to the NRA. The NRA gives $ to GOPs to oppose data based measures that prevent mass shootings.

90,"@celiajlozada @TJG4GA Yeah!  It takes money and press to get broad exposure, and both are in short supply for the Democratic side of this race.  A Congressional race with good coverage costs $1M-$2M.  Big money donors hold back on disadvantaged primaries.  It's like pushing a boulder uphill."

96,@NerdAthens The pro life lobby wants a legal doctrine that a fertilized egg is a person (ignoring bodily autonomy‚Äî when does a person have a right to another person‚Äôs body for survival.). The end game is to ban hormonal birth control lest it expel a zygote. Thus more unplanned pregnancies.
97,@NerdAthens Colorado is a great case study‚Äî one of the most progressive states on reproductive healthcare with one of the lowest abortion rates due to free/low cost IUDs. Teen pregnancies down 56%. Abortion rate down over 40%.
98,"@NerdAthens The response to that argument is that progressive policies and administrations accomplish way fewer abortions than ‚Äúpro life‚Äù policies/admins, so if you‚Äôre pro life do you want A) fewer dead fetuses or B) MORE dead fetuses, but with performative talk about how it‚Äôs wrong."
