8,@GOPLeader You could have listened and we would have been ok.  Nobody was available and now it's too late!  #epicfail
9,@joerogan I had a plan Legislators wouldn't hear weeks ago.  Under 1 trillion and we would have been out of this by now.  Minimal changes could have been done.
10,@GOPLeader Also because you do not hear us!

21,"@springfieldNL That's what happens when nobody will listen.  @springfieldNL @GovParsonMO @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS.  Now almost a month after I started to attemp to contact any of you with a plan.  Trillions of $s later it seems you are getting ""prepared"" to do exactly what I said!"
22,@JoeBiden Your not and you won't be sir.  You won't even win the nomination at this point.  It will go to Coumo.
23,@POTUS @WhiteHouse @Mike_Pence @GovParsonMO @realDonaldTrump  with respect and sadness for what you are going through with this Pandemic.  You think the American People will do the right thing.  For the most part we will.  The fact is you are going to have to pull the trigger!
24,@springfieldNL Good moron should pay dearly!
25,@mattgaetz PLEASE CALL ME 3 MIN.  WE COULD SAVE TRILLIONS JUST HEAR ME OUT PLEASE!  417-551-5531
26,@Mike_Pence @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump WE CAN SAVE TRILLIONS but you REFUSE TO HEAR OR LISTEN.  Keep my check I wont pay for this.
27,@WhiteHouse @POTUS NOBODY IS AVAILABLE to listen.  There is a way to save TRILLIONS and come out of this quickly.  You can keep my check I will not pay for this.
28,@GOPLeader You won't listen or even hear us out.  I will not pay for this and you can keep my check!
29,"@GOPLeader What do I have to do to get you to hear me for 3 minutes?  What laws do I have to break, Who do I have to threaten, who do I have to kill just for 3 minutes that could save TRILLIONS?  WHY WON'T ANYBODY LISTEN TO US?  NOBODY IS AVAILABLE!"

37,"@benshapiro The strike in 1992, haven't watched a game since then."
38,@CBSNews I recognized 6 of them.
39,"@mikeparson Pumping money into the economy, ok. Making a deal with all utilities, phone companies, and banks for no billing for a 2-3 week period, so the working people that don't normally depend on the government can go home and isolate would have been better. Now the clock will start again"
40,@CBSNews Maybe when they take that virus home and kill their parents or grandparents it might become serious to them.  No it won't...they will blame the Government!
41,@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately Martial Law for 3 weeks is the only way!  I have a plan that almost all logical people will agree with.  Please atleast hear the plan!
42,@WhiteHouse Americans are not going to self quarantine by themselves.  To get ahead we must tell everyone to stay home and keep the utilities on.  In the grand scheme of things 2 weeks will be bad but months would be catastrophic.  Activate the process before it is too late.

46,"@Mike_Pence I support what is being done.  Have any of you ever tried to contact the IRS?  They are not equipped for robbing us the way they do, how are they going to be equipped to help employers with pay ect?  What about 1099 employees?"
47,"@MysterySolvent Have you ever been upclose and personal with an incident of this magnitude?  Either during, immediately after during search and rescue?  Have you seen the aftermath in person?  Have you been able to pull 1 living person out while their spouse laid right next to the and died?"

60,@realDonaldTrump Billy Long say's you and he are connected at the hip...is that how it is? You have my respect as a business man and as our POTUS! Billy Long has invested in broadband companies all the while pushing for those companies to expand!  If that isn't unethical what is?
