0,@POTUS Solidarity with Ukraine! Ban Russia from SWIFT now!
1,"@eshaLegal @uncle_authority This is hilarious. I am very aware of class, and I have consistently been on the side of the poor and working class, but human rights are human rights regardless of class, and should be respected. 

Also, do you really think that China is Communist?  They seem pretty Capitalist."
2,"@eshaLegal @uncle_authority I really don't care what she was charged with, if your aurgument is that ""she deserved it because she was a terrorist"".  If her story is true, her ""charges"" are irrelevant."
3,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal Funny, I posted an interview with a woman from a news Network in France, as she lives in France.  I didn't say that it was all absolutely true, I only said that it could be, and the claims should be taken seriously."
4,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal Again you're denying people's claims of torture.  People are just saying ""they were paid off"" without providing any solid evidence of that."
5,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal Yet you use the term as a weapon on people you don't know at all.  and you haven't proved that it's a ""fake"" issue, you just keep repeating it. But good job redirecting from the actual issue being discussed."
6,"@strimond @eshaLegal So again, a statement put out by the government."
7,"@strimond @eshaLegal And it's not possible that the Chinese government would engage in propaganda? You assume everything the US puts out is a lie, yet other governments aren't capable of that?"
8,@eshaLegal @strimond and what if it's not? It has to be a lie just because that fits a specific political narrative?
9,"@strimond @eshaLegal This thread is based on opinion, sounds like propaganda, and does not prove that she was lying."
10,"@eshaLegal @strimond A lot of things don't make sense. If that did happen, they could have just been injecting all of the women, for simplicity."
11,"@strimond @eshaLegal https://t.co/aAJq3eWJw2

So listen to this woman's testimony and tell me that she's lying and paid by the US State department."
12,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal I guess if you didn't tweet about it, then it didn't happen right?  But way to try to belittle someone based on gender, how woke of you!"
13,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal I happened to get on and ask a question that turned into a debate. But, apparently it's really offensive to suggest that the many Uyghur testimonies of torture might actually be true."
14,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal I've also barely been on Twitter for the past year, but good to know that you have to post about everything that you care about, to prove that you care about it."
15,"@uncle_authority @eshaLegal Also, interesting how caring about human rights automatically makes you a ""liberal""."
16,@eshaLegal The outright denial of well documented torture and human rights abuses to defend a state because of ideology is cringe.
17,@uncle_authority @eshaLegal Being concerned about human rights abuses in one place does not prevent you from being concerned about them in another place.  And they are not imaginary just because you want them to be.  Do you think there is only one issue in the world?
18,@eshaLegal Wow! I've actually read these people's accounts and they are horrific. To downplay and joke about it is sick. I think these claims need to be taken seriously.
19,"@eshaLegal I did read this, what is your point by underlining this sentence?  You are denying claims of torture by dozens of people."
20,"@eshaLegal So 50 people have given testimonies to Amnesty International.  To make the claim that all of these people are lying about their experiences and torture seems absurd.  At what point do you consider the possibility that it could be true? 

https://t.co/kwlyzPrX1T"
21,@eshaLegal My point is that there have been many testimonies about these camps come out. This was just one. How do you explain all of these people's claims?  Are you suggesting that they are lying?
22,"@eshaLegal So if it was all made up by one person, why have there been so many testimonies of torture by Uyghur survivors? This is just one.

https://t.co/Dzhlo7dYgS"
23,"@eshaLegal How is it ""cringe"" to be concerned about the mass detention of minorites?"
24,@davidsirota More people should do that.
25,@Sen_JoeManchin Your legacy will be destroying our planet for your own personal profits. Disgusting. Do you even care about your grandchildren's future in the slightest?
26,"@jmflynn74 @popscribe @mary_db10 @KFILE What jobs? Insurance jobs? jobs that literally deny people life? Find another job. We're short on nurses.  If the rest of the developed world can make universal healthcare work, so can we."
27,"RT @caitycoyne: No matter what they say, how many politically strategic visits they take to struggling communities or how much they claim t…"
28,@iventuspr @elonmusk Fuck what up? The fossil fuel industry has already fucked everything up.  What is your solution? Go to space? that's rediculous.
29,"@elonmusk Hope? From what? a dying planet? Space is not tenable, please use your money to preserve rainforests and plant food forests everywhere, desalinization plants, clean energy. There's way too much work that needs to be done here on Earth. 

That's the most hope for the most people."
30,@FrankenberryWV what?! How did you hear that?
31,@Noortwyck @shaunking Because too many black lives have been taken by the police. Don't be a racist scum bag.
32,"@Sen_JoeManchin Our voting rights are under attack. Here in West Virginia, and across the country. It’s time to get on board. End the filibuster, and protect our voting rights. Stand up for the people and our Democracy. History is counting on you."
33,"When you start calling for means-testing for aid, it's just an excuse to barely give anyone anything."
34,"Kamala Harris gave an interview on TV in West Virginia advocating for the new stimulus plan 

This made @Sen_JoeManchin upset. He started rambling about how all efforts to pass the bill need to be ""bipartisan"".

Why would he say it needs to be bipartisan unless he's a Republican?"
35,@ZKamath @RyanEGraney @KellyannePolls Maybe you should get therapy as well? If you think this is acceptable parenting?
36,"@Sen_JoeManchin, why are you so bent on blocking $2,000 checks when the people of West Virginia who you represent are some of the ones who need it the most?"
37,The police just opened the gates and walked away. So weak. https://t.co/qcsm6YHpdq
38,You cannot support both Trump and the Constitution.  He is a traitor. https://t.co/6S1KJcxbTI
39,@RepAlexMooney You contributed to this by letting Trump and his lies get out of control. You should have stood up for truth before this got so crazy! These are your people. Educate them!
40,@MatHelman @DeptofDefense @NationalGuard Traitor!
41,"Because the Department of Defense is headed by Trump, and he literally just purged anyone who wasn’t loyal to him. So they’re willing to risk the lives of our congress people? https://t.co/2azbpofQhV"
42,"This is an idiotic attempt at a coup d’tat, and it’s not going to work!"
43,"@gregkellyusa Your an idiot Greg Kelly. These thugs broke windows and have backpacks that haven’t been checked. This is a dangerous situation, and all of these people need to be arrested."
44,@DanCrenshawTX Lol
45,"I'm excited @CallForCongress is running again in Washington. Let's help him fundraise early! He came very close to winning his primary, and if we do help him early, we have a really strong chance to have another progressive in Congress:
https://t.co/LBzsPOIyv7"
46,"There are a new wave of Democrats in WV that support progressive policies. Did @Sen_JoeManchin  notice that all 4 congressional nominees in WV were progressives?  Democrats lost hard in WV because of decades of Democrats selling out to corporate interests, and the Trump cult. https://t.co/nEfBdrsM93"
47,"@Sen_JoeManchin Please stop with the Red Scare tactics, we don't need more Republican fear propaganda."
48,"@claudialacroix @jessicajin_ @Sen_JoeManchin What does this have to do with Fascism? AOC was talking about holding people accountable for supporting a man who is literally trying to subvert our elections and constitution.  Believe it or not, Nazis were held accountable after Hitler's rein."
49,"@LISound203 @Sen_JoeManchin Ok, Captain Knee Cap. What about my platform was Marxist?"
50,"@LISound203 @Sen_JoeManchin Also your ""true colors"" is that you are full of hate. You literally wished harm on me, and then threw out some weak platitudes pretending to be Christian. Don't be a hypocrite."
51,"@LISound203 @Sen_JoeManchin Yeah, I really don't think you understand Marxism at all. I don't claim any specific ideology, but I at least try to understand philosophies. When you attack everyone left of you as ""Marxist"" you're kind of stuck in the 50's."
52,"@LISound203 @Sen_JoeManchin Trump Cult. That was the reason. Glad he lost though. You said you're praying for me, yet you also were wishing personal harm to me in a previous tweet? Interesting."
53,@claudialacroix @Sen_JoeManchin I don't think you're stupid. There is just a lot of misinformation out there. I just really encourage you to go back and read that history since you brought it up.  Look at the definition of Fascism.
54,"@virginiabelle76 @hammerdaas Yeah Kat, all Democrats lost by that margin, because the majority of West Virginia unfortunately has fallen into the Trump cult. Glad he lost though! Hopefully, we can get more funding for our education system now."
55,"RT @RebeccaforWA: It's such a joke that true universal healthcare, housing for all, and the planet not erupting in flames is considered ""fa…"
56,"@LISound203 @Sen_JoeManchin Wow you're really full of hate there, I wonder where you learned that."
57,"@claudialacroix @Sen_JoeManchin Hitler was a fascist, just like Trump. That's on the opposite side of the spectrum."
58,"@hammerdaas Again, you haven't substantiated your point. You're simply spewing out hate. Goodbye."
59,"@hammerdaas Okay, so you can't even explain yourself. Your own misogyny and ignorance is really shining through."
60,@hammerdaas Completely missed the point there. You’re “translation” makes no sense. Can you explain how you got from point A to B? I’m REALLY curious? 😂
61,"@Sen_JoeManchin Stop trying to demonize all forms of socialism. What do you think public schools are? What about FDR’s New Deal? Are you saying those are bad too?
Medicare for All would literally save tens of thousands of lives every year that our private system is failing to do. https://t.co/U3uWzNlwMI"
