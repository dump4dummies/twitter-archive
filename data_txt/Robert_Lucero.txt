0,@JebBush Way to blow an opportunity to be relevant again. The SCOTUS decision immediately endangered the lives of thousands if not tens of thousands of women. Your sentiment is the equivalent of supporting an immediate Taliban threat to Americans. Pig.
1,"@millanpatterson @MichelleSteelCA @YoungKimCA @OCGOP Really enjoyed it, two gems💪🏽"

3,@millanpatterson @JoeBiden @TheDemocrats @CA_Dem Yes they are.
4,"@conanNBCLA @NBCLA We mobilized the greatest economy and crushed global fascism in less time, Dec 7, 1941-August 1945, but yeah, 4 years isn’t enough to solve this or ANY problem.
Could she be more status quo?"
5,@HansrajMeena thank you for following me!💪🏽 I am getting exciting reports about our exit polling right now. We feel good about our chances to compete and BEAT @AlexPadilla4CA in the fall!
6,@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP In our last declared war. Let’s end the chickenhawk policy of permanent war.
7,"@tvjames @ABC7 @GOP @NRA @RepKinzinger The worst element I’ve seen while campaigning is the lack of acceptance of responsibility for the whole of the national situation by most people, club members, candidates, and media. Cynicism is my enemy."
8,@tvjames @ABC7 @GOP @NRA @RepKinzinger I’m trotting “the American people have to stop being delusional a—holes” line.
9,"@tvjames @ABC7 @GOP @NRA @RepKinzinger BOTH parties have become dead and disgusting, left to their own devices. That’s why the status quo got creamed in 2016, not because the country racist (Trump) and socialist (Bernie) at the same time, sound absurd enough for you? I’m trying to lead, not follow."
10,"@tvjames @ABC7 @GOP @NRA I might be the only GOP candidate for federal office that is challenging the b.s. interpretation of the Constitution by the NRA and their all too gullible/enraged supporters.
Please let me know if I’m not."
11,"@NPPinCA @OCGOP How is it global when it’s run by a small number of clubs? The Federal government must act, REGULATE, use the muscle of government over global corporations, which we have done before. Reagan said the problem was gov’t, I have to disagree. The problem is ineffective gov’t."

15,"@TruncatedJest Right. Show us where JFK said that kind of stupid crap PUBLICLY. You can’t. NO President has ever been so stupid or senile as to openly advocate regime in Moscow. And for an encore, shuffling Joe threatened war with China over Taiwan. Great. Where are the peacenik progressives?🤷🏻‍♂️"
16,"@2020Blackstone @ShellenbergerMD Thank you! We are getting great polling results, feeling good. I fully support Michael as well, a great candidate and a great friend.💪🏽"
17,@mattgaetz Complete bullshit. And NOBODY under 25 should be allowed to walk out of a store with two AR-15s and 400 rounds!

19,"@RNCResearch @millanpatterson It’s the end of “gobble-ization” and the New Weird Order of global, corporatist, one world government."
20,"@Jriefe I am a pro gun reform GOP candidate in this June primary. I think the people accusing candidates of being RINOs often sound like Confederates.
Let me know if we can talk."

22,@tgalida @ABC7 You’re an engineer that doesn’t know that “too much” is not a scientific measurement of any sort?
23,"@AndyShrader @ABC7 Nuke the problem, use SMRs. It’s “insanely expensive” to allow the Fed to push hyperinflation and bailouts of derivative trading lunatics over the last 14 years. Let’s get serious about THAT &amp; use our money for the biggest infrastructure renaissance in history! @NibCoalition"

31,"@RogerMarshallMD @SenateGOP Yet we can afford tens of trillions (since accurate figures aren’t provided) from the Federal Reserve into derivatives and other speculative bubbles, especially since March 2020? The truth is student debt is NECESSARY to keep the bundles of worthless debt churning. Pop the bubble"
32,@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP Does anybody have the DATA on this 2 million figure? I really just want to see it.
33,@teragramus @SenAlexPadilla @RepCardenas Still thinks he’s in the state senate apparently. Only working with his roommate @RepCardenas on bringing token projects back to the valley. This is what happens when you get hired by a friend and you didn’t read the actual job description.

37,"@paragisadimwit @millanpatterson @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi I’m a former independent Democrat (LaRouche organizer from the anti-Cheney days). I am running for U.S. Senate, on the June 7th ballot. I am running to help create stronger leadership among candidates for real fundamental change, which is what voters were asking for in 2016."

45,"@SenateGOP This is all of course absolutely terrible. But when will we, the American people, ADMIT that our policy of pushing NATO to the border of Russia, floating the idea of Ukraine’s membership in NATO and the EU, has had a lot to do with provoking this. Anyone? Anyone?"

47,"Biden's speech in Poland was an open call for regime change in Russia. He ended it by saying ""For God's sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power"".

No President during the Cold War was EVER foolish enough to say that, a direct threat to the Russian State.

Beyond dangerous."
