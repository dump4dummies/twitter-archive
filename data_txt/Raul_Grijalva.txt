@realDonaldTrump, ripping children away from their parents does not make you holy. It makes you a coward. 

#KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/A8RkcGFK0u"
30,Absolutely disgusting. First it was #DREAMers who were brought to the U.S. as children through no fault of their own. Now it's victims of gang violence and domestic abuse that this administration is unilaterally blocking from seeking refuge. https://t.co/qGiuxCbyo1
31,"This is a new low, even for the current anti-immigrant #Trump administration. Shame on @BetsyDeVosEd for instilling fear into our children. Our schools are places of learning, not anti-immigrant hate. https://t.co/BxGTd85UX3"

https://t.co/zIvJjCVFxl"
37,"Dr. Tipirneni cut the GOP lead in a district that Donald Trump won by 21 points down to 6. Results like these here in Arizona show what we are capable of if we organize, mobilize and fight for what we believe in. The results will follow."

https://t.co/cdGqOmcgwS"
