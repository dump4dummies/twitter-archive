1,"Steve Chabot's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is anything but new. He's been working against the LGBTQ+ community for decades. Unless we step up and do something about this, it will continue. Join us in the fight to protect all Cincinnatians from people like Steve. https://t.co/sgRhEH1UdY"
2,"Any candidate can say they support the LGBTQ+ community in their city, but talk is cheap. We believe the city of Cincinnati deserves concrete legislation and immediate action to create complete equal protection under the law.🏳️‍🌈⁠

EXPENSIVE CHILDCARE
NO QUALITY OF LIFE https://t.co/5CfxqOfwfs"
11,"It’s hard to believe that today marks the 1 yr mark of this man’s public execution. A very sad day in American and human history. 

His death was not just a catalyst for activism and protests.

George Floyd was a man.

14,"35 R's voted for a 1/6 commission - Chabot wasn't one of them because he doesn't want want to investigate an event he helped inspire.

19,"This country was literally built by immigrants. Specifically in Cincy, by 1890 57% were born in Germany or had German parents.

29,"@Rockindacazbah Hi there, thanks for the question! While I personally would never get an abortion, I don’t believe that it’s my or my government’s right to impose those beliefs on others. I believe that it’s a woman’s right to choose what she does with her body."

43,"&amp; Darnella Frazier is one of the heroes that made this trial possible. Her steady hand unwaveringly captured Floyd the entire time.

44,There are still many more #GeorgeFloyd every damn day. We can’t let up now.
45,"#BLM is not about murder trials or being against police, but about preventing the need for these types of trials in the future. It’s about stopping the system of oppression that causes police to discriminate against black people in the first place."
