36,"Millennials, I need you to join in this fight to save Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid for your mothers, fathers, grandfathers, grandmothers, and the parents who have worked hard to create opportunities for their children."
37,"Before Soc. Sec. was created by Dems &amp; FDR, too many seniors lived in abject poverty before dying poor. Mdcr. &amp; Mdcd. has saved millions of lives &amp; provides healthcare for so many seniors &amp; families. We can't let the heartless GOP destroy the safety net created for all Americans."
38,"Trump lied again. Remember when he said during the 2016 campaign that he'd protect Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid? Lies! Now after giving tax breaks to the rich, he is going to cut these programs to make up for the deficit he blew up. Democrats will not stand for it."
39,Democrats must make the fight against these cuts to seniors our primary issue! I'm in this fight and I'm not going to quit until the Republicans back off our seniors.
40,"Our seniors, who have worked hard, raised families, paid their bills, and have always honored our democracy are under attack by the GOP. McConnell has announced that the way to rein in the deficit is to cut off the most vulnerable people in our society."
41,"GOP must think the American people are fools w/the proposed Soc. Sec. MDCR, &amp; MDCD cuts. They gave tax breaks to the richest 1 %, adding $1 T to the natl. debt, &amp; now they want to make seniors, families, &amp; the poor pay for it. I won't stand for it &amp; will fight them tooth &amp; nail."
