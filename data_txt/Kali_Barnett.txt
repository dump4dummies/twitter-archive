24,"458 days ago, I launched my campaign to represent #KS01. For 458 days we have worked, built, and connected across this district. We are ready. 

Today has been 458 days in the making. Let’s do this."
25,"I've been using my voice my whole life. Now I want to use it to fight for the people in the Big First. If you can, chip in a few bucks to help us get across the finish line. I can’t do this without YOU!
https://t.co/bygAG0YCJH https://t.co/1iVt6o0EEQ"
26,That feeling in your stomach right now? That’s the excitement of everything about to change. Are you ready to make history in the Big First?
27,"This should alarm us all. Still my opponent can’t be bothered to even wear a mask to keep our communities safe. That won’t change if he wins. The Big First deserves a Rep who actually cares about the health and safety of the district
https://t.co/zrNoX0v1GP"
28,"Less than 24 hours left. We can do this. Can you chip in now to help make it happen? Absolute last chance to be part of history here.

29,"Get those ballots in, and if you are planning on voting be sure to mask up to protect the health of other voters and all of the fantastic election workers and volunteers! https://t.co/3mR81MIFga"
30,"The politics of the past can’t solve the problems of the present or prepare us for the promises of tomorrow. Only a positive change can do that. The future of the First District is bright, but we all have to come together and claim it. It’s up to us."
31,"Only two more days until we flip the Big First and send this teacher to Washington. Can you help us in this final push and chip in a few bucks so we can make it through the finish line? 
https://t.co/bygAG0YCJH"

38,No one should have to choose between paying for their medications or putting food on the table. That’s why I will stand up to big pharma and fight to lower prescription drug costs.
39,A medical emergency shouldn’t end in bankruptcy. We have to make sure everyone has access to comprehensive health insurance at a price they can afford so everyone can get the care they need.

41,"Farmers are not pawns to be used in trade deals, but my opponent thinks that they should be happy to be the “tip of the spear” in Trump's trade war with China. Farmers aren’t tools to be used in political games—they’re PEOPLE with families to feed."
42,"Don’t have a cow, but there are only 5 days until Election Day! https://t.co/ad7MLPq8Vh"
43,"Kansas counties with mask mandates had a lower rate of COVID infections in October than those without. That’s not politics, that’s science. We should listen."
44,"Tracey Mann is still knocking on doors with no mask. If he can’t do the minimum to protect Kansans while campaigning then why should we expect anything different if he were in Congress? Like he says, with him what you see is what you get."
45,"Trump joked that farmers are doing “better now than they did when they actually had to farm.” There is NOTHING funny about losing the farm. I know because it happened to my family. 
We owe our farmers fair trade, not jokes about their livelihoods."
46,Thinking about all the positive change we’ll make after we turn the Big First into the Big Blue next week... https://t.co/2Xm5dePl3i
47,"My opponent is thrilled about the Supreme Court confirmation, b/c just like D.C. Republicans, he doesn’t care if Kansans have access to affordable healthcare. We should be EXPANDING access, not ripping it away.
Just one of the many reasons Tracey Mann is wrong for Kansas. #ksleg"
48,"One thousand and seven Kansans lost to COVID-19. Grandparents, parents, children, siblings, friends, partners.  In honor of their memory, we must commit ourselves to do all we can to prevent even one more life lost.

54,"Senate Republicans couldn’t pass COVID relief for struggling Americans, but they took up a Supreme Court confirmation just 8 days before an election, confirming a justice they hope will help rip healthcare away from millions in the middle of a pandemic. We deserve better."
55,"The White House says they can’t (or won’t) control the spread of the virus. Congress needs to step up and take action. I’ll be a leader who holds the President accountable, no matter who it is."
56,"My opponent likes to pretend he’s not a politician, but he is. As Lt. Governor, he followed in the footsteps of the Brownback admin, &amp; even ran for this same seat 10 years ago. I’m not running to build my resume. I’m running so we can actually have a voice in Congress."
57,"The forecast shows snow sweeping across Kansas this week, but all I see is a blue wave coming! https://t.co/eYtsxN8iMG"
58,I’m not running to play games or to further a partisan divide. I’m running to stand up for people like my dad—people who work hard and just want a fair shot to make a living. We need a leader who is one of US.
59,"Rural Kansas is seeing the highest numbers because folks like my opponent say we don’t have to take the same precautions as cities and urban areas. Why doesn’t he want to keep our communities safe?
https://t.co/zaXvQhGW3T"
60,"The White House has now had two chances to demonstrate leadership and set a good example for how to respond to a Covid outbreak. They failed to do so both times. As a teacher, I know how important it is to set a good example, and that’s exactly what I’ll do in Congress."
61,"The First District has elected the same kind of leadership for over 60 years, and we wonder why it feels like no one is standing up for us in Washington. On November 3rd we get to change that. Chip in now to help us make it happen!

https://t.co/zTCfRVsrKy"
62,"I’m not running to represent a president or a political party—I’m running to represent people. I’m running to represent the hardworking people of Kansas who deserve their own voice in Congress.  
https://t.co/g28bNnspKK"
63,"The choice in this election couldn’t be clearer: 

My opponent is running to represent Donald Trump. 

I’m running to represent KANSAS."
64,I shudder to think what our state will look like on the other side of this pandemic if we don’t get our small businesses the help they need right now. This isn’t about politics—people’s livelihoods are on the line.
65,"Kansas agriculture contributes over $49 billion to our state economy. As we grow our economy out of this pandemic, we have to set our farmers up for success by making sure we have fair trade deals and stable markets. Our economy and our families depend on it."
66,Farmers aren’t pawns to be used in trade wars. They are the biggest economic driver in our district and should be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I will fight for our farmers every single day.

68,"We know a thing or two about wind out here in Kansas. Trust me, windmills don’t kill all the birds and they don’t cause cancer. They’re a great source of clean energy, and one the First District led on for years. We need to get back to leading on clean energy."
69,Have you made your plan to vote? We need your voice to be counted. Know where your polling place is. Return your mail-in ballot ASAP. Text 5 friends and make sure they’re voting. We can’t sit this one out!
70,"Congress makes so many decisions that affect our schools, teachers, and students. We need more educators helping to make those decisions. That’s why I’m running for Congress. Can you help me get there? 
https://t.co/bygAG0YCJH"
71,"I have been without health insurance before. I know how scary it is. No one should have to go through that, especially in the middle of a pandemic."
72,"No one chooses to have a pre-existing condition, and they shouldn’t be denied coverage because of one. I’m running for Congress because politicians in Washington need to STOP playing games with our healthcare."
73,"The news of this outbreak should alarm us all. We need to do everything we can to protect our communities and the most vulnerable among us. That starts by taking this pandemic seriously.
Lives are on the line.
