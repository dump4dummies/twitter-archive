1,"@SenStabenow @EPAMichaelRegan Government overreach will create jobs and ""tackle"" the climate ""crisis?"""
2,"@EPAMichaelRegan @EPA @POTUS So where is the analysis on 2nd and 3rd order effects? Since there is no emerging combustion technology that will drastically increase gas mileage, manufacturers will be forced to reduce vehicle weight.This will most likely result in reduced safety and increased death and injury."
3,"@Ilhan @POTUS Wait...did you just refer to yourself in the third person? Oh wait, one of your staffers wrote this. Probably one who has a ton of student debt. Adorable."
4,@tedlieu It makes me feel like you are a shameless politician who continues to feed off Trump Derangement Syndrome. If only you cared half as much about the embarrassing remarks coming from the current president.
5,"@RepPressley So now protecting the lives of the unborn, especially those disproportionately victimized in communities of color, is white supremacism? Do you even hear what you are saying?"
6,"Can you imagine if you couldn't pay your household's monthly bills and you went to the credit card company and asked them to INCREASE your credit limit...then you went on a shopping spree!?

7,@POTUS https://t.co/UX88Aq8nwM
8,"@POTUS Wow. Unfortunately the numbers say you're a liar. In 2018, the top 10% earned 48% of all income and paid 71% of all income taxes. The other 90% only paid 29% of all income taxes. Fair share, huh? While Marx would be proud, this is America... take a hike!"

https://t.co/UojprMR16q"
11,"Insurgency? So you mean like the ""Resistance"" after Trump was elected? For those of us who fought the war on terror, terms like Insurgency mean something. Vilifying millions of Americans as ""enemies of the state"" because they hold a different political view is abhorrent.#redwave https://t.co/iwkurD1Ue9"

15,And now their chickens have come home to roost.  Lives have been lost due to the left's weaponization of the vaccine. https://t.co/15omvZqYet
16,"Why is it ""protecting"" our right to vote means a federal power grab to ensure states are incapable of actually protecting the right to vote? But you're counting on that fraud to stay in power, aren't you? https://t.co/vne5CLFJwI"
17,"I am speechless. What a brazen lie @ewarren . The Heritage Foundation is tracking over 17,000 CONVICTIONS of voter fraud. Can you imagine how many have actually taken place without detection, prosecution, and conviction? Conversely, where are the cases of voter suppression? https://t.co/Ens9mmQME2"

21,@tedlieu The use of fear and terror to indoctrinate our children is exactly why so many Americans don't trust you and your Progressive cohorts. There can't be reasoned policy debates balancing economic impact with climate impact when EVERYTHING is a crisis! https://t.co/tFLF4Rn9j5

It’s left-wing authoritarian politics."
24,@AOC You straight trippin'
25,"And what, @RepAdamSchiff  is NOT a ""fundamental right?"" The last I checked, you don't pay for rights. I never received a bill for Life, Liberty, or the Pursuit of Happiness. We all want roofs over peoples' heads, but that is the product of hard work and an open economy! https://t.co/hnnAaK6Yda"

27,@jessemermell The problem is it won't be YOUR tax dollars. We have the largest national debt since WWII. This would shackle my children and grandchildren with even more debt. ENOUGH!
28,The Dems embrace of radical leftist ideology is exactly why I'm running for Congress in #VA10. I want my four children to grow up in a country where they are judged by the content of their character. #CRT is NOT the answer! https://t.co/ktFPnjD4zd

33,Why is it @RepWexton and the squad have politicized support of our Law Enforcement by only supporting those from Jan 6th? Meanwhile they demonize all those who stood against violent leftist mobs in 2020. https://t.co/85Bt4yP1o6
34,@AdamKinzinger that is an absurd analogy. There WAS an unarmed woman who was a victim of deadly assault that day. She was shot for climbing through a window. That you would compare the Capitol Police Officer who pulled the trigger to a female assault victim is inexcusable. https://t.co/p5UGvzZuOD

37,"Always so generous with other people's money aren't you @ewarren ? These ""evil"" billionaires aren't swimming in gold coins like Scrooge McDuck. They are invested in companies that employ millions of Americans. They create jobs, wealth, and opportunity for all. Wise up! https://t.co/0Yy2sYt3pS"
38,"Oh, you mean ACTUAL infrastructure? If only the bill weren't also laden with pork, bailouts, and progressive overspending. Our national debt now exceeds GDP for first time since WWII. Shameful. https://t.co/sg5mvaO2tK"

https://t.co/XeXUGncEKe"
42,Or...maybe that just means he isn't in the pockets of the unions like @TerryMcAuliffe . I would rather someone like @GlennYoungkin who has skin in the game than someone who is beholden to out of state donors and special interests! https://t.co/3m1XOrHoUP

55,"@RepWexton for once we couldn't agree more.  This is a sadly predictable result when you and your progressive cohorts seek to disarm law-abiding citizens, de-fund law enforcement, and put criminals above victims. The injured don't need your thoughts...they need public safety. https://t.co/OYFv7l0aCk"
56,Over the years I've grown to recognize the tone of desperation. @TerryMcAuliffe is resorting to fear and deception because he knows @GlennYoungkin is the better leader for Virginia. https://t.co/AgeN178ukz
