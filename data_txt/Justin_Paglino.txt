2,"@ASewcialist It’s a milder ad hominem to call someone elitist instead of dumb, but it might still get reflexive self-defensive push back, instead of the self reflection one is hoping to evoke. Maybe depends on the person. In my experience, people are reflexively reluctant to admit many flaws."
3,"@ASewcialist Yes, It’s hard to have productive conversations with people when they resort to ad hominems. “You wouldn’t understand,” etc. I find myself doing it too, sometimes, it can be hard not to, but it is to be avoided as much as possible. It usually derails any progress."

8,"@Muck_Fountain @ninaturner @kburton40 Yes I know, you would vote for a dog if it were a democrat just to keep republicans out of office. You vote lesser evil.  I too used to think the two party system is all we will ever get. I too was well trained not to expect more. Then I learned about #RankedChoiceVoting."
9,"@Muck_Fountain @ninaturner @kburton40 It’s quite a position of financial privilege to be satisfied with the way our economy is run under republicans and democrats. Bill Clinton’s welfare reform and NAFTA were no skin off your back, I’m guessing. But for millions they were. Glad you are doing well."

20,@AbeDrayton @slappymacfrodad @sQuadrepellant @EmmVee15614486 @TheDemocrats I’m not against that but I think it needs fleshing out. Do you mean like DSA?
21,"@AbeDrayton @slappymacfrodad @sQuadrepellant @EmmVee15614486 @TheDemocrats Yes, we need issue organizations, like ACLU, https://t.co/fgZqQ19MrK, DSA, you name it, sure. But if those organizations support Dems instead of 3rd party, it is just the old way of doing things, and not transformative. We need an electoral revolution, an independent left party."
22,"@AbeDrayton @slappymacfrodad @sQuadrepellant @EmmVee15614486 @TheDemocrats I hear this opinion often and it never makes sense to me. You want to change the country without changing the lawmakers? Without changing the laws? This “proposal” is DOA. Yes the system is set up for 2 parties, so we have to change the system. #RankedChoiceVoting is step one."

40,Abortion is a medical procedure. All healthcare decisions are private decisions between you and your doctor. This is fundamental to good medical practice. In no situation should doctors be compelled to call the cops on their patients because of any private healthcare decision.
