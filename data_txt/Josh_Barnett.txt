4,I want to go to DC and shrink the federal government. Anything not enumerated in the Constitution must be sent back to the states. Decentralizing the Feds power and going back to a true republican form of government is what needs to happen.

40,"@Tradeshows2021 LOL I can tell by the comments. The Democrats supported Jim Crow laws, started the KKK, and didn’t support civil rights act. Wake up and pull your head out"
41,@Tradeshows2021 It’s factual. The left is the party of racism.

52,It’s a disgrace that @speakerbowers sine die without doing anything to correct election issues. Nothing significant was passed. He’s worthless as a legislator. Thank goodness @DaveFarnsworth_ will win and Rusty will never hold office again.
