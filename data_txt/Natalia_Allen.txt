2,"Will the individuals who enter the labor market have the required skills and knowledge? If we don’t have leaders address the issues in education today, they will become the issues of our economy tomorrow.

3,"RT @NicholasFerroni: “But, Will They?” 

They will. https://t.co/6YdsZ7LTE7"
4,I want people to think about all the EXTRA duties &amp; responsibilities that educators &amp; education support employees have taken on due to the teacher shortage. It’s not sustainable &amp; I fear we will just continue to see the shortage increase unless we implement a viable solution ASAP

6,"What kind of labor force are we producing? Will our students today, have the skills necessary to be gainfully employed in 5, 10, or 15 years? How will that affect our economy and GDP? We must #MakeEducationAPriority to secure a future for all!"
7,If we continue down this road with inaction or delayed action we might not be able to fully recover. Think about the skills and knowledge our students are missing out on due to the teacher shortage and sitting in empty classrooms.
8,"It’s no secret that we are facing a nationwide shortage of teachers &amp; temporary instructors. We need viable solutions now…fund our public schools, properly compensate all education professionals, including paraprofessionals &amp; clerical staff. We need to look the long term impact."

16,"There needs to be more accountability and transparency, in addition to program evaluations of the additional support being provided to historically under-resourced schools."
17,"I’ve had the honor of working in education in Missouri, New York and Florida. Although no two schools are the same, they share similarities as it relates to school performance in education. The underfunded, and under-resourced schools perpetuate a cycle of low performance."
18,"Working in a school, you’re not limited to education issues. You see all the issues facing our communities, including but not limited to immigration issues, economic issues, poverty, youth homelessness, healthcare issues etc."
