3,It’s great that many companies will cover travel costs for employees whose reproductive freedoms are being rescinded by their state. They should also move their headquarters to states that protect a woman’s freedom to make her own decisions. Businesses can lead by leaving.
4,"If you oppose government mandated pregnancy and government encroachment into your body, please mobilize and join the resistance against those who aspire to rescind even more of your rights. Believe me, they’re planning to do so."
5,"Elections have consequences, none more upsetting than today’s. Withdrawing a woman’s right - one established a half century ago - to make decisions about her body and her future is abominable. Mobilize, energize, and organize. We need you this November. All of you."

7,"The Texas GOP rebukes @JohnCornyn for trying to reduce gun massacres, declares the 2020 election illegitimate, shames the LGBTQ community, wants to overturn the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and MO GOP Senate candidate releases this repulsive ad. Radical is right. https://t.co/kHj5eqHct1"
8,"Today we observe #juneteenth2022 - the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in Texas in 1865. Freedom is fragile, opportunity is inconsistent, and the struggle continues 157 years later. https://t.co/B0kvlugDQx"
9,"There isn’t a more principled member of Congress or one working harder to restore faith in our government than @AngieCraigMN. Her opponent, afflicted by the disease of lying, appears to be the exact opposite. In politics they call that “contrast”. https://t.co/5LKNLJQvZY"
10,"A GOP candidate for Congress endorsed by @EliseStefanik who believes,“we need more leaders like Adolph Hitler”. Radical, disgusting, and downright dangerous. This is what we’re up against. https://t.co/IG7ZtK9mEt"

12,"Hello, @birkmatt. Your alma mater’s chart affirms MN’s response was similar to Democratic bastions like AK, GA, NC, OH, PA, WI, &amp; WV. Glad to see you care about students in poverty.

16,"If you care about a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, I suggest you mobilize, organize, and do everything you can to re-elect @GovTimWalz and Democratic majorities in the Minnesota House and Senate this November. REAL tyranny will be on the ballot. #RoeVWade https://t.co/EJfc9OwYK1"
17,"Come on, @BirkMatt. It was Robert Mueller, a respected Republican, who issued the report about Russian “interference” in the 2016 election. That’s called evidence. What’s YOUR evidence that Minnesota’s elections aren’t fair and secure? We’re all waiting… https://t.co/Dne4IZTtQ5"
18,"I don’t like coming in last place, unless it’s the @OpenSecretsDC ranking of Members of Congress who take PAC money. That’s a last place trophy I covet.🏆 https://t.co/r9rTCBadLU https://t.co/VzBkhjAGlM"
19,"Sure, @BirkMatt. This 2020 report from your alma mater, Harvard Univ, should suffice. Conversely, what evidence supports your decision to actively undermine faith in our elections? That might go a long way in giving Minnesotans facts rather than falsehoods.https://t.co/QDyRZpQtYg https://t.co/VOsxkAr7LU"

39,"I was in the Capitol on Jan 6. Ds and Rs alike feared for our lives, walked over blood, and are indebted to the officers who protected us, who died in the aftermath, and the 140 who were injured.

59,"While it won’t affect the outcome of the election, every vote in every state in every election MUST COUNT. We can’t afford the erosion of faith in our electoral system due to errors like these.

65,"How can so many of our leaders care so deeply about defending America from foreign adversaries, but care so little about defending us from covid-19 and the undermining of our democratic institutions?"
66,"My friend, @RepRiggleman lost a primary in part because he officiated a same sex wedding. And he’s among just a few Rs to aggressively condemn QAnon and issue congrats to @JoeBiden &amp; @KamalaHarris. Too few in Congress place principle over party, but Denver is one of ‘em. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/FsaxQCq9Cy"
