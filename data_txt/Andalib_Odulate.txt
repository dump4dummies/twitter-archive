6,"@rayy_manzain @Viupcake @CadenJCLol @ethanmiley_ @TerfElite Yeah and I would, (although there are treatments that allow for infertile women to give birth) the point is that the impossibility in our current time makes having kids and being in a cis, trans, relationship impossible. It's simple a nice way to convey your preference and goals."
7,"@Viupcake @CadenJCLol @ethanmiley_ @TerfElite What if you want biological children? Then it's important that the person you are with is cisgendered.

(Note this hashtag is dumb and clearly just made to make trans people feel shitty)"
8,"#BidenActNow

Biden needs to bring the US back to military isolationism. Tell the world unless the United States territory is directly attacked the US will not get involved in any conflict.

9,"@handsomeharold_ @GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC She is biologically a female, she never grew testicles, never had male body structure, and has way more estrogen then anyone born a male has."
10,@handsomeharold_ @GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC She went through puberty as a female so I don't see  your point. I said if a transwoman transitioned before puberty im totally fine with them playing in the woman's league

12,"@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC That's tricky if she has lived her whole life as a female so I don't think it's fair to disqualify her.

I'll conceid a bit and say sports that are more skill based than brute force should be completely trans inclusive. Like WMBA, women's baseball/softball and others."
13,"@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC Define as, testosterone and estrogen levels and bone/muscle density.

14,@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC Edit take hormones before 18 abd physical transition after.
15,"@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC 100% agree since it only ""pauses"" puberty. Then let then due surgery at 18."
16,"@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC I understand it's personal and hard.

Would you support hormone and physical tests to require they have no biological advantage before playing? After they reach that lever then letting them play?"
17,@GlauSciathan @josh__gesell @AOC Why is this the hill people are dying on. I support LGBT rights. I don't support trans women in women's sports unless they transitioned ore puberty because whether you want to admit it or not it's an advantage to have grown up as a man as it's easier to build muscle and mass.
18,"@treythesurfer @kclyle1 @Sen_JoeManchin @SenStabenow Probably true but if he was in office today he never would have done the racist stuff.

The point is how his progressive legislation lead to democratic control for 1/2 a century."

1. If we don't lose the house they can't overturn anything.

2. It would be political suicide to repeal any significant progressive legislation remember ACA trys?"
