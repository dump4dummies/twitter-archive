22,"Enough excuses. The Democratic Party has to change — now. 

If we want to get something different out of Washington, we need to send someone different to Washington. https://t.co/ZnmHSueR7G"
23,"That a sitting U.S. Senator believed Kavanaugh wld uphold Roe is less an indictment on him (though having a rapist overturn Roe is certainly not lost on anyone) and more on the unfit nature of said Senator, when one must only acquire a pulse to determine that Kavanaugh is a liar. https://t.co/WfKi7XtaUy"

35,"@JulieMilnerEsq With respect, we are not fine in New York. There are not nearly enough funds, doctors, or resources to address the influx of people who will be coming here. We also don't have a constitutional right to an abortion in NY."
36,"In the immediate term, one of the most effective ways we can support people seeking abortions today is by donating directly to funds working on the frontlines in our fight. 

https://t.co/nyhU3yifJH"

To say so, is intellectually dishonest with everyone we represent. https://t.co/p2q2K5NG5N"
43,"The GOP has been working for years to buy a conservative-majority Supreme Court. Their plan has been transparent and it's working as we are witnessing the dangerous consequences today.

Democrats can no longer be resistant to using their fullest power. Expand the Supreme Court."
44,This is devastating. Expand the Supreme Court.
45,"I cannot emphasize enough, how devastating a decision this is."
46,"SCOTUS: ""The court holds that NY's ""proper-cause"" requirement to obtain a concealed-carry license violates the Constitution by preventing law-abiding citizens w/ ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their 2nd Amendment right to keep &amp; bear arms in public for self-defense."""
