1,"@TulsiGabbard Have you checked out the Libertarian Party Platform? If you want decentralized government power, Individual Liberty, less government spending and overreach you should check it out and your state Libertarian Party.
Registering and voting Libertarian tells the DnRs to do better!"
2,"@soonercarroll @ToddHagopian @SenatorLankford There will be a Libertarian on the ballot for both seats, with an additional 5 candidate state wide!"
3,"@HorizonEyes4L @givetrumpareal1 @MAJTOURE Since it's been the Democrats and Republicans running up the debt, keeping us at war, mishandling taxpayers' money and infringing on individual rights, it is quite apparent that they have no idea what they are doing running a government."
4,"@HorizonEyes4L @givetrumpareal1 @MAJTOURE By ""know how to run a government"" do you mean rack up over $30.5 trillion on debt, get involved in foreign conflicts we have no business being in, misuse taxpayer money, and infringing on the very right of the individual that the entire purpose of the government is to protect?"
5,"@givetrumpareal1 @MAJTOURE There were 3 options on all 50 ballots. The ""two party system"" is something that Democrats and Republicans use to make you believe that there is no other options. All it takes is for more people to vote for the best option, not of the lesser of two evils and their system crumbles"
6,@LibertyDrew84 Get to feeling better soon brother.
7,"@MotherPuncher36 @KamalaHarris Because he is an individual and has the right to his own opinion. Libertarians have a variety of views when it comes to  protecting life and abortion. Libertarians aren't just pro-life or pro choice as a party, you're allowed you own personal beliefs."
8,"@Shade_Nox @KamalaHarris Decriminalization of Marijuana and psilocybin, actually reducing the deficit, get rid of some of the unconstitutional federal agencies, and other things that Republicans won't do is part of it. Unlike Democrats we have actually supported the right to love who you want since 1971."
9,"@Bathtub_dwane @Red39411367 @Johnny_Velocity @MAJTOURE You mean you don't like the primary principle of individual rights, limited decentralized government that gives people the power to make decisions  about their own Life, Body and Property without the use of force or coercion?"
10,@Red39411367 @Johnny_Velocity @MAJTOURE Kinda figured that people might be able to figure it out by the tag or might actually get curious and look into it. Gotta try some different approaches every now and again.
11,@givetrumpareal1 @MAJTOURE I don't know if you can even consider them two separate parties really. They are just two sides of the same authitarian system that keeps the people under government control.
12,"@JoeBiden So elect the candidates from the Libertarian Party, since they are the only party that supports bodily autonomy and individual rights?"
13,"@givetrumpareal1 @MAJTOURE Actually it the Libertarian party.

Both DnR party members use force of the government to dictate what you can do with your body."
14,"@Johnny_Velocity @MAJTOURE I was referring to the 3rd largest political party in the country, not the DnRs."
15,"@Johnny_Velocity @MAJTOURE Same as the Democrats, keep them illegal and put minorities in prison for having them seems to be pretty much the it across the board from Legislators in DC."
16,"@KamalaHarris So are you really telling people to vote Libertarian? Since that is the ONLY party on all 50 ballots in the last several national elections that actually support bodily autonomy, the only party with  Candidate's that stand for Individual Rights and Liberties?

17,@Belmont_1983 @ShaneTHazel Thomas Jefferson warned us we shouldn't leave it on more than about 175 years.
18,@HorizonEyes4L @POTUS When?
19,"@HorizonEyes4L I'm not Bernie, I'm not a grifter. I'm just tired of Democrats and Republicans screwing the working class."
20,"@HorizonEyes4L Yeah,  nothing about being from the government. https://t.co/g70nKqqa0V"
21,"@HorizonEyes4L The Bill of Rights was intended to keep the Government from infringing on your rights. Not to give them to you. ""Constitutional Rights"" are those mention in the Constitution. Which per the 9th amendment, protects those not mentioned."
22,"@HorizonEyes4L Your Rights don't come from the Constitution either. The Constitution sets the structure of the Federal Government and delegates some power to that government. You are born with Rights, they are yours, not to be infringed unless you are doing harm someone else or their property."
23,"@POTUS That's all government does, take away the rights of individuals."
24,@MAJTOURE You know that's the way BOTH Democrats and Republicans roll. Only one party has shown consistency when it comes on keeping the government out of your personal life.
25,"Your Rights should alway come before party likes and dollar signs when it comes to how your Senators vote. Your Rights don't come from the government, the government can only take them away."
26,"@SInhofe @HorizonEyes4L @SenatorLankford Just miss typed while rushing to feed the trolls on break at work. Not sure if you have a job or not, but when you actually work for a living it takes up quite a bit of time."
27,@SInhofe @SenatorLankford What burden of proof is needed for those judges to sign and what should the penalty pe for those who falsely accuse?
28,"@HorizonEyes4L @Joe53927015 @meat_popsicle5e @Grynch_84 @ksorbs Unless you count freeing victims of the criminal justice system so we can afford to incarcerate people who actually deserve to be in prison.
Stop sending troops overseas to come back with injuries and PTSD.
Allow veterans to get medications that help instead of doing more harm."
29,"@britneysho @pidlezen @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 They already have. 

The gradual erosion of Liberty, until Americans have no desire or willingness to be free, full summit, and we are all slaves to the federal government with no means of liberation. 

Sad to think we're heading that way quicker than you realize."
30,"@EdMac1951 @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 Apparently atm it depends on the State, this give more power to the federal government. Whether you're a Democrat, Republicans or are fully aware that both are corrupt and untrustworthy you should be able see that giving more power to the federal government is a terrible idea."
31,"@ksorbs The cry of the classical liberal.

Next you'll be screaming ""TAXATION IS THEFT""
or saying 
""The ATF, should be a convenience store not a federal agency""
Maybe ""don't hurt people and don't take their stuff"""
32,@EdMac1951 @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 If her former intimate partner decides to get a Protective Order on her then she would be required to relinquish custody of any firearms.
33,"@TCSCushing @ksorbs As long as you're not doing damage to someone else's life, body or property there's no place for the law to step in."
34,"@Joe53927015 @meat_popsicle5e @Grynch_84 @ksorbs By that logic most Democrats and hardly any Republicans mentality age past 15-19. The whole democratic agenda is based on emotional plea, and most of the actions lack any rationale."
35,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 So you're call officers ""terrified and vengeful"" or maybe referring to secret service?
I've taken psychology and sociology  classed, and one big takeaway from them is nothing in either field is ever proven, it's just a working theory. 
Say dependent and I'll prepared if you want"
36,@POTUS https://t.co/pavaqBWnZ2
37,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 Yes the School was a ""gun free"" zones, and the Officers stood by with their guns for over an hour. Then again per the Supreme Court ""officers have no Constitutional duty to protect your life""

It does only take a GOOD Guy to stop a BAD GUY.  It's a lot easier when properly armed."
38,"@SInhofe @SenatorLankford Maybe in New York that's the case, here in Oklahoma boyfriends, or girlfriends count too. https://t.co/bah6WMFrtv"
39,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 I actually noticed that the CDC had removed those estimates.  I figured it was due to the anti-gun lobbyists outcry after armed officers stood by while a lunatic slaughtered children for over an hour in a ""gun free"" zone. Which non of the current laws on the books prevented."
40,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 Seems like someone with a bias approach trying to downplay the usefulness of having a means of protection. Especially coming from what appears to be article publishing by an organization focused on ""gun violence"" it apears to be coming from abias source."
41,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 I only had the opportunity to skim it during my work break. Obviously when you narrow the scope of what you consider crime prevention it will lower the number, as will only targeting victims of certain reported crimes. Then throwing out reported uses to prevent assaults."
42,@JOnAthAn4RealZ @verified I know he's the RealZ Deal.
43,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 https://t.co/QtbE91QXBt quick link that should send you to it hopefully. 
Yes, most stats on DGU are estimates since they are recorded by state or federal authorities. If I remember right they were wide like 600,000-3mill. Personally, I know people who have used guns defensively"
44,@CadetChimp @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 All it takes is an ex that's willing to commit perjury and the cops will take the guns and leave him fear free. This literally gives abusers another tool to harm their victims.
45,"@pidlezen @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 No, the federal government can use funding to force the states to infringe on individual rights,  much like they did to force states to raise age of alcohol sales by without federal funds for roads. I have as much faith in both parties as you do for whichever one you don't like."
46,"@JohnnyNasheo @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 Are you counting the CDC study that suggests there are upwards of 3,000,000 crimes stopped by the victim having a firearm a year?"
47,"@inthisageandtim @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 So you don't know what redflag laws are,what they do or how they can be abused?"
48,@SInhofe @SenatorLankford You mean it closes the loopholes that's already on the background check to buy a firearm?
49,@pidlezen @TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 So you don't know how redflag laws or federal government funding works?
50,@CadetChimp @SInhofe @SenatorLankford When red flag laws are used by an abuser to disarm their victims it's a bad idea for the person who wants to defend themselves or their family.
51,@JodyFrates @makenziryanne @SenatorLankford Exactly. Criminals don't obey the law and giving them an option to disarm their victims doesn't make them less dangerous.
52,"@SInhofe @SenatorLankford Those redflag laws can work both ways, disarming a victim doesn't put them in the best position to defend themselves."
53,@TulsaTeresa @SenatorLankford @fiji2002 Meanwhile there are those that live everyday thankful that the 2nd amendment can allow a woman to protect herself from baseball bat violence when multiple men break into their home.
54,"@SenatorLankford I know how I'd vote on it, hope you'll vote the same way."

58,"@HorizonEyes4L @JoeBiden Not sure how eliminate the deficit, wasteful government spending, unnecessary government agencies and allowing more people to keep the money they earn would be considered wanting to waste money.  How is advocating for individual liberty as long as they don't harm others bad?"
59,@HorizonEyes4L @KamalaHarris You mean the right to prevent your own murder or that of your family?
60,@HorizonEyes4L @JoeBiden Which policies am I for that want to waste money? Just out of curiosity.
61,"@KamalaHarris Democrats have been destroying this nation for 200 years. They can't and won't help build anything to help the individual in this country, they will only continue erode the rights of the individual like they have for decades."
62,@stormyokla @SenatorLankford @UnitedWay @unitedwayokc Or the mental and physical trauma caused by being forced to fight in foriegn wars for political gain by both Democrats and Republicans?
63,@RhondaWhetston1 @KamalaHarris The Democratic party has been that way since their inception and has no plans to change.
64,@JoeBiden All we're asking is that the largest most inefficient entity in the nation stop wasting money.
65,"@MarkRPellegrino Psychological Thriller, Fallen."
66,@JoeBiden Then why do you continue to do so much harm to the middle class and working poor?
67,@KamalaHarris While you keep pushing to remove our most fundamental right as Human Beings: the right to protect our lives.
68,"@KamalaHarris Didn't you put thousands of people in prison for using a medicinal plant?

Don't Democrats often sue to keep other parties, like the Green and Libertarian off the ballot?

Did you not push for the unvaccinated to not be able to make a living?

Does your hypocrisy know no bounds?"
69,@SenatorLankford Don't forget about the over spending under Republicans!
70,@WeCantWait1 @KamalaHarris That largest portion of gun fatalities are suicides. The presence of firearms still stop more crimes than the number of deaths committed with them.
71,"@WeCantWait1 @KamalaHarris The best deterrent to being beaten, stabbed, rapped or robbed. But I'm sure you can't wait until criminals can abuse people without a means if defense. Bad government and criminals always prefer unarmed victims."

79,"@WeCantWait1 @KamalaHarris There's several socioeconomic factors that go into crime rate and police shooting other than the United States have natural human rights protected by the Constitution, or the fact that Australia, New Zealand, and the UK have banned the best form of personal defense."
80,"@WeCantWait1 @KamalaHarris Over 1,000 of those gun deaths are from police officers. If think that's bad, wait till you see what happens when inky government agents have guns."

82,@POTUS One way to lower the cost of moving goods is to lower the fuel cost.
83,"@ArkansasTomsBBQ @BernieSanders Definitely need to reign in Government and cut Government spending. Fixing the tax code would help too, especially when we can get the rid of the deficit, get rid of the debt and get rid of the 16th Amendment."
84,"@KamalaHarris More people are beat to death with hands and feet than killed by rifles.

The problem isn't guns, it's people like you and Joe causing suffering and hopelessness in the country."
85,@VP How much stock do you have in Pfizer and Madera that you want to subject children to a shot with such a poor percentage of effectiveness?
