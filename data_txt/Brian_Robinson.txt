5,@HowardGraubard @ParkSlope4Brian @VoteBrianBP @bkdems @ericadamsfornyc @Pinnyringel @NYDailyNews @CityAndStateNY @nypost @PoliticsNYnews @BoroPark24 I ask again: So your problem with me being a pro Israel public safety focused moderate at a time where Antisemitic violent hate crimes are up over 300% is what exactly? To what do I owe the great honor of your hostility?
6,@HowardGraubard @ParkSlope4Brian @VoteBrianBP @bkdems @ericadamsfornyc @Pinnyringel @NYDailyNews @CityAndStateNY @nypost @PoliticsNYnews @BoroPark24 So does your hostility have just a little bit to do with being part of a group that endorsed a progressive that‚Äôs running against me?

20,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust I won‚Äôt be bullied into changing tweets based upon your twisted agenda fueled interpretation. You‚Äôre probably used to that.

23,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Wow. I don‚Äôt think you actually have any idea. I was also in a few special education classes in middle school. I was told it was because I had special educational needs. I‚Äôm not interested in your semantics. Anyone without political motivations would see what I was saying.

26,@MariamaJames @sider_uw @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Nor do you know me. Hasn‚Äôt stopped your attempt to defame me. You are smart enough to know your nonsense helps your preferred candidate even if I do give you the benefit of the doubt that Yuh-Line had no part in this.
27,@MariamaJames @sider_uw @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Right. Totally. You did a great job today. Now don‚Äôt you have some socialists to endorse or something?
28,"@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust That‚Äôs garbage. You calling me racist benefits Yuh-Line who you have supported publicly. Combine that with your call with Tammy Meltzer, who also attacked me today in praise of Yuhline directly, and you look foolish."
29,@MariamaJames @sider_uw @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust I have ADHD. Wrong person to pin that on. I wrote an entire book about this subject. You are way off base.
30,@MariamaJames @sider_uw @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Nobody here is desperate but you in your defense of your ridiculous claim (not for Yuh-Line as you claim). It‚Äôs like you have the far left playbook of how to demonize everyone who isn‚Äôt far left so the city keeps burning and you succeed
31,"@MariamaJames @sider_uw @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Your attacks are so fanatically transparent. Just because I didn‚Äôt include every hate crime minority victim in ONE tweet doesn‚Äôt make it racist. You, as the far left, along with the far right, are what‚Äôs wrong with this country. No logic, just attacks without logic."
32,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust I defended her. That‚Äôs a lie and borderline defamation. Everything your doing knowingly is. I called her a radical but defended her on that. https://t.co/rgHUc6BueE

39,@jillgoodkind I have condemned hate crimes against anybody no matter the race without hesitation innumerable times. It‚Äôs really not justified to take one tweet and twist it out of context.
40,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Nope. I actually defended her. and I have the proof. On to the next thing I see. You have lost my complete respect.
41,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Have a lovely rest of your day!
42,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher @yuhline @britnimust Thank you that was extremely helpful.
43,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher There it is! Tammy Meltzer. She came at me on WhatsApp today on behalf of Yuhline. You just literally proved my point that this is all @yuhline @britnimust knows. It‚Äôs everyone against Wagner where Yuh-Line refuses to come out and defend it
44,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher Oh my god. Ok keep it coming‚Ä¶..
45,"@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher Why do you keep coming at me on behalf of her? So far today: Racist, Delusional, what else? I never once disrespected you. Admit your political motivations based on documented support of her or let it go. I had another one from her camp last night. It‚Äôs coordinated."
46,"@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher I‚Äôm intent on not letting you bully me with your claims of racism. If you had respectfully said something to me instead of retweeting me implying I‚Äôm a racist, we actually could have had a conversation. You chose to attack me on behalf of Yuh-Line. This is typical far left BS"
47,@MariamaJames @TheKvetcher Enough. Your intentions are impure. You‚Äôre here for Yuh-Line. Twist my words around as you wish. I do agree that people are smart enough to see what you‚Äôre doing. He‚Äôs getting traction? Quick call him a racist. Thought you were above that.
48,"@Lora_Tenenbaum @MariamaJames I‚Äôm not pandering first of all. Secondly, these are people who are concerned, as am I, for the surge in crime here in NYC. Seems reasonable, actually. https://t.co/N9LD72C5mR"

53,@Lora_Tenenbaum @MariamaJames Nope. It was before she tweeted it.

58,@MariamaJames @Lora_Tenenbaum Twice you implied I‚Äôm a racist. Same thing. Politically motivated. We both know who your candidate is.
59,"@MariamaJames @Lora_Tenenbaum Sorry my tweet with a maximum of 280 characters did not meet your every expectation. I guess you should just stick with calling me a racist then. Usually shuts people up, right? Don‚Äôt devalue that word by using it for the purpose of political attacks. I‚Äôm well versed in that code"

70,Working as hard as humanly possible.
