7,I'll say it once and I'll say it again -- those on the left spectrum are AMAZING at going at each other's throats. They fight their own allies harder than they do those that literally have the opposite set of beliefs. It will continue to be our own downfall.

26,RT @phantomhitch: Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.
27,"@kharmakelley I know text has no tone, but that's awesome &amp; I'm glad you're fighting the good fight. I'm supportive of helping people become stronger advocates, but I'm also supportive of supporting those allies in a way that keeps them in our fight. We desperately need them w/ us."
28,"@kdc Great - &amp; if ppl want to use those resources, more power to them. Some people want to help directly as opposed to through an organization which sometimes can be unhelpful due to red tape. Point is, now isn't the time to be policing ways ppl want to help."
29,"@kdc Yes, let's continue to push our allies away because their level of ""advocacy strength"" isn't to your liking. There is always going to be new ppl to the fight and we need to welcome them as opposed to pushing them away because it isn't to the advocacy establishment's liking."
30,@kharmakelley We are SO GOOD at being the enemy of our own allies. Those who all have the same aligned interests are fantastic at tweeting/attacking each other over every thing instead of learning to be allies and learning from each other and working together to overcome our obstacles.
31,"@kharmakelley It's about creating a welcoming environment and easing those into the fight for advocacy as opposed to outright shaming them for ""doing it wrong"". Let's talk ego. Ego is when you shame others because you feel you're way is the only way. Let people be kind &amp; advocate."
32,@ZachRodriguez Let's all be allies together rather than picking a part each other. Not saying you specifically just in general.
33,"@blackpnwlady Oh, here comes the ""only advocate and help how we approve"" police again. Ppl just want to be kind &amp; helpful. Most ppl have common sense to vet &amp; check. Most post for ppl they know already. Posts like these turn people off from getting involved because then they'll be shamed."
34,Can we stop the policing of people's advocacy? A lot of people are angry. They want to help. Just because they aren't advocating or helping in the way YOU want them to doesn't mean they're bad people.  Many are new to advocacy. Stop shaming them because YOU don't approve.
35,"@ZachRodriguez Oh god...not the ""you can only advocate how we want you to advocate"" police again. People w/ common sense know not to reach out to strangers. I posted for those who know &amp; can vouch for me. Let's stop policing people's kindness."
