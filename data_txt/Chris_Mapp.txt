0,"@RepAdamSchiff Make no mistake, the 2020 election was stolen, you know it, I know it, and the American people know it. we all watched the numbers changed on national television. We all watched the vote counting stop in the middle of the night and counting was blocked from verifiable view."
1,"@RepAdamSchiff The 2020 election was stone in plain site, you know it, I know it and the American people know it."
2,@POTUS You can‚Äôt help but to fail the American people; you are a cull. Stolen elections have consequences.
3,"@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP If you‚Äôre a United States House member and you sold your country out to a Chinese spy because you were getting laid, you should probably say it out loud. #FangFang"
4,"@MichaelBerrySho You are so correct. My heart breaks for the American people because of what they‚Äôre willing to sacrifice to maintain their comfort and safety, instead of what they‚Äôre willing to sacrifice to maintain liberty and freedom. Leader ship it out the window right now."
5,"@AdamKinzinger Almost all men ages 18-25 who are U.S. citizens or are immigrants living in the U.S. are required to register with Selective Service. Citizens must register within 30 days of turning 18. Immigrants must register within 30 days of arriving in the U.S. 
What age?"
6,@RepAdamSchiff I wish you would find a new job. You‚Äôre terrible.
7,"@POTUS ""Our Enemies despairing of carrying their point by force are practising every base art to effect by bribery and Corruption what they cannot accomplish in a manly way."" George Washington, General Orders, September 26, 1780

Compliments of George Washington Society"
8,@GOPLeader Eisenhower plan!
9,"@Ilhan So when the government shift supplies from legal tax paying American citizens to the suck the country dry - illegal aliens that are invading our country, that is a monopoly issue! A communist government monopoly issue. Stolen elections have consequences."
10,"@MichaelBerrySho I wish it were so. It is not that way at all, and to tell you the truth, I don‚Äôt know when people will stand up."
11,"@MichaelBerrySho Like JFK , the economy was assassinated on national television while all of America looked on and no one did anything to stop the carnage. We are in serious trouble."
12,"@TomFitton Until weapons are used to repel our borders and those currently in Power are indicted and sent to Gitmo, this is not going to stop. What they do not realize is this puts us on a direct course for a 2nd Civil War. Make no mistake it was not unintentional by those who hate the U.S."
13,"@RepAdamSchiff Roe v. Wade must go. Next: Gay marriage annulled; the construct of civil union initiated. 
There can‚Äôt exist in a civil society laws for genocide and laws that go against the basic God given tenets that gave America her beginning and continued existence. We are paying the price."
14,"@ChrisMurphyCT You have it wrong. 

Contributing to genocide is not popular.

Predatory teachings to all kids is not popular and, the adults in their life should be held responsible.

Pornographic &amp; critical race theory ideologies in math books are not popular.

Most Dems need serious help."
15,@RepSwalwell Did you criminalize Fang Fang? You are a criminal that divulged information to a Chinese spy and you should be escorted out of office in chains.
16,@MichaelBerrySho A social media post or tweet would just end up in oblivion without the intended consequence for the story writer. Like yelling into the wind while standing on the beach.
17,"@MichaelBerrySho I have been thinking about your current post here. The problem with your analysis which I agree with 100%, is as an individual we do not have the power of the microphone, to set the record straight with a rogue reporter or paper or media outlet. Stay the course good job."
18,@MichaelBerrySho Ann Landers - Berry? New show segment.
19,@townhallcom Works for me.
20,"@RepAdamSchiff Free press?? Are you shitting me, the Democrat party has paid for them over and over and over. Nothing free about today‚Äôs press. Cheap, yes. Free, no."
21,"@JoeBiden You ignorant boob, it‚Äôs genocide."
22,"@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP So let me get this straight. Are you  ridiculing the GOP for bad decision making?? 
Is this something you and fang fang discussed or is this part of your new moderate family approach? 
If you‚Äôre going to be a sell out to the country please do it with a straight face."
23,"World press and, freedom day in the same breath? So let me get this straight. When the constitution gives your industry an irrevocable right and you sell that right for a profit in order to accentuate your own skewed viewpoint, doesn‚Äôt that give prostitution a whole new meaning?"
24,"So let me get this straight. The, then, supreme court justice who threw the entire country under the bus for political gain for Obamacare is asking for an investigation into a leak by another justice or clerk whose politics come before the country as well?? Is there a trend here?"
25,"@ChrisMurphyCT So promoting an agenda of homosexuality aimed at children is disgusting and that is not free-speech, that is immoral behavior that preempts free-speech. You would not yell fire in a theater.
Your view is clearly skewed."
26,@RepAdamSchiff @ZelenskyyUa @SpeakerPelosi You are almost the sole hand behind a fake Russian dossier and you have the audacity to talk about brutal Russian government overreach????
27,@RepAdamSchiff how about you give your salary and your investment earnings to those less fortunate that would like a living wage instead of those who have a entry-level position and learn to make more money on their own.
28,@RepSwalwell There is another kind of predator that preys on those who are oblivious to the consequences of playing deadly games. Whether it‚Äôs a spider or if it‚Äôs a snake the question you have to ask yourself is does it have Fang- Fangs?
29,"@RepAdamSchiff Some people see guns as merely a tool. A tool to put food on the table. A tool to protect their person, family and property.
A tool to protect their country.
A tool to remove slimy, ill-conceived, spoiled, indulgent, predatorial, criminals and other vermin from their threat zones"
30,"@SPBMcKenna @DonaldJTrumpJr Newsflash, the 2020 election was stolen in plain sight. President Trump definitely had an ability to over tweet. President Trump loved his country and never contrived edicts that went against the national security and the hard-working men and women of this country.   
Truth hurts"
31,"@RBReich Free speech is always welcome. The difference is, one is attempting to promote a platform where speech works on both sides. Kaepernick used his ability for free speech for grossly inappropriate negative AMERICAN bashing while attempting to steal the spotlight. What a contrast."
32,"@NikkiHaley it has nothing to do with fair, it has to do with communist policies from an illegally elected regime attempting to transform the United States into a Third World country."
33,"@RepSwalwell We all don‚Äôt have a Chinese spy in our inner circle to use as a sounding board. I don‚Äôt care how many pics you post of you and your family, Fang Fang will be your downfall. You have no room to speak on any subject, least of which would be the border. The criminals are Democrats."
34,@MichaelBerrySho only contempt?
35,@elonmusk please don‚Äôt confuse fun with what needs to be said out loud today.
36,This needs to stop now.
37,"@MichaelBerrySho I believe in western medicine. I will not accept the fact that we never took on those in China and the US who caused the mayhem on purpose. I will not accept the mask mandates. When we change the definition of the word ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù I was out. 
Wide open borders at the same time? mmm"
38,"@RepSwalwell Remember not all Democrats are criminals but mostly speaking, all criminals are Democrats."
39,@RepSwalwell Did you check with Fang Fang before posting this irrelevant Tweet?
40,"@ChrisMurphyCT Some, most, many, Democrats are complicit in using our kids as weapons for social engineering."
41,@MichaelBerrySho The air raid sirens are blaring yet no one seems to hears them.
42,@RepAdamSchiff Sound familiar. Is where you got your blueprint?
43,"@GeorgePapa19 Obama is the single greatest threat to our nation. Not because he has some great anointing  power, but because people are lacking in their ability to discern good from evil."
44,"@RepAdamSchiff You disingenuous traitor. You have your head so far up Nancy Pelosi‚Äòs ass, you dare accuse speaker McCarthy of Authoritarianism?  What a joke. A very perverted joke."
45,"@RepSwalwell If Kevin McCarthy had his own Chinese spy like Fang Fang, and gave up secrets under seduction, would he then be required to hold his children for the Twitter feed for credibility sake?? üòÇ"
46,@townhallcom another fucking wack job liberal.
47,"@Ilhan The problem with unassimilated foreigners becoming lawmakers is their lack of capacity to comprehend that freedom requires greater responsibility to achieve, than just giving the farm away and returning to the chaos they left behind. #itisnotsupposedtobeeasy"
48,@RepSwalwell Did you discuss this with Fang Fang before posting?
49,"@MichaelBerrySho No sir, it is a show and tell and Abbott is only accentuating Biden‚Äòs policies.
Seal the damn border, back it up with weapons. Cut off all trade from Mexico shut their economy down until they handle their own cartels or give us the greenlight to handle it for them. We‚Äôre at war."
50,@newtgingrich Biden is a traitor
51,what a mistake!!
52,@RepAdamSchiff Time for spoiled indulgent contemptible lying refuge like yourself to exit stage left. You are poisonous.
53,@MichaelBerrySho Welcome aboard.
54,"@POTUS Jackson has no business on the Supreme Court, much less ever being nominated. Woke and subversive are the first two disqualifiers."
55,"@RepSwalwell @oliviarodrigo At your house, is the F bomb Fang-Fang? You should resign in disgrace or maybe you could hold twins to look more like you give two shits."
56,@POTUS Were you born a dumbass and a traitor or is it something that you learned and earned along the way?
57,"@Ilhan Jobs like those at McDonald‚Äôs are entry-level jobs and they are meant to be transitioning work to learn the basics. Jobs like Mcd‚Äôs were never intended to be a living wage.
The problem with you people, Third World foreigners is you come here to prosper yet don‚Äôt learn the culture"
58,"@MichaelBerrySho I realize you try to be fair in many ways on your radio show. The call out for the workingman and the lesbian to have a beer, whether you believe it or not accentuates what should not be an issue into an issue and gives credibility to those who want to exploit/indoctrinate kids."
59,@MichaelBerrySho human resources is now the contemporary communist policies that operate within American companies. sad.
60,"@RepAdamSchiff If I told you, that you were just full of shit, you wouldn‚Äôt believe me, but when you‚Äôre a narcissist that‚Äôs just the way it works."
61,@AOC Hush
62,"@Ilhan Work promotes self worth and dignity. 
Handouts steal self worth and create dependency."
63,@RepAdamSchiff You sir proved single-handly that the DOJ is compromised. We all know you are as well.
64,"@RepAdamSchiff How about you find you in contempt? Because I sure do, and so do the American people. It must be a bitch to be a fraud and call someone out for the same."
65,@AskTheJage @SaraCarterDC There is a cure for this behavior.
66,@MichaelBerrySho Stolen elections have consequences.
67,"@RepAdamSchiff Sir, your accusations are reckless and unfounded. There is no more room for you and your sleazy kind in government. The real President , Donald J. Trump had fuel prices at record lows and stable if you recall during his legally elected term."
68,"@NikkiHaley People have short memories and will only remember what affects them directly. Sad to say, but is true. This is why we have a lack of robust leadership in our government."
69,@BernieSanders Are you jealous?
70,@BuckSexton It is about submission.
71,@RepAdamSchiff What about your crimes that include a fake dossier to unseat a legally elected President?
72,@Ilhan Only in America are legislators this stupid.
73,"@MichaelBerrySho Yep,"
74,@BernieSanders Is being incoherent a qualification for being an office holder in our current period?
75,"@RepAdamSchiff You are an election rigging, Russia collusion, dossier faking, communist lying son of a bitch. I could give it to you in shorthand, fuck you. You‚Äôre headed to Gitmo if I have my way about it.

Respectfully
Chris Mapp"
76,"@BernieSanders no we need to end our dependence on fossilized politician hacks like yourself, Biden, Harris, and Pelosi, communist hacks."
77,@DailyCaller Ransgendertay isay entalmay llnessiay.
78,@MichaelBerrySho At all cost.
79,@MichaelBerrySho Very true
80,@RepSwalwell Is this what Fang-Fang told you what happens in China? #pillowtalk
81,@RepAdamSchiff You are a communist and a liar.
82,@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP Did Fang Fang tell you this?
83,"@JoeBiden You and your regime lieutenants have put this country in peril, and you are unfit as well as those around you to represent the United States national interest. It is my belief you are all guilty of treason. In the end our country is resilient and you and yours will fail miserably"
84,"@Jim_Jordan Then you are you saying, Democrats want to be Autocrats? üòÇ And they are!"
85,@JedediahBila Wrong
86,"@SPBMcKenna @Jim_Jordan Trump lost because the 2020 election was stolen in plain sight.
Election Integrity matters; stolen elections have consequences.
 Trump showed us how big &amp; ugly the swamp is; America 1st policies were spot on. I‚Äôll take a bit of ego over a treasonous liar any day.
#NotABlueDress"
87,@RepSwalwell Fang Fang for twenty?
88,"@POTUS King, you have no clothes on."
89,@MichaelBerrySho Lindsey Graham did not know he had a set of cojones until Trump got elected.
90,"@RepAdamSchiff Reached out to the same folks that you conspired with against Trump? 
You are a race-baiting jackel."
91,@RandyBarv @Oupavia You might be defective.
92,@MichaelBerrySho I will bet you $1500 we have a treason problem.
93,@MichaelBerrySho Because they are racist? üòÇ
94,"@MichaelBerrySho Biden is a cull when it comes to being a man. He is a traitor and has sold out the United States to Russia and China. Now he sells out Ukraine by turning a blind eye and not rallying NATO or free country forces to stand up to a communist invasion.Ôøº
#Electionsmatter"
95,"@RepAdamSchiff You are a treasonous son of a bitch, and that cull that you call a president is a waste of space. I hope to see all of you up on charges of treason and in jail. 

#electionshaveconsequences"
96,@RepSwalwell Do you think Fang Fang will come over and help clean up?
97,@RepAdamSchiff Why so you can fuck their country up too?
98,@RepAdamSchiff You are a fucking scum liar and I can‚Äôt wait to see the cuffs put on you.
99,@MichaelBerrySho I hope they take hostages.
