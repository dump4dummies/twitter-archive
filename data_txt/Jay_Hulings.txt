21,"@eliehonig Also, to be a crime, the quid pro quo doesn’t have to be included within the same phone call as the request. It can be implied by circumstances (e.g., the withholding of aid before the call) or communicated by an agent (e.g., Giuliani) in separate communications."
22,RT @ChrisMurphyCT: Unreal. That the Secretary of State would unequivocally endorse this kind of corruption is mind blowing. A black stain o…
23,Amazing how fast the partisan ranks are closing. The President using official action to extort a foreign power to investigate a political rival should be universally viewed as an egregious crime. Probably would have been 20 years ago. Those days are apparently gone. https://t.co/VU1rWxDoI6
24,I prosecuted several public corruption cases as an AUSA. The exchange of official action (US aid to Ukraine) in exchange for a private benefit (investigation of a political opponent) is the definition of bribery. This is all anybody should be talking about. https://t.co/M4w8ef0W24

43,"@benjaminwittes So the Bureau would have to do it on its own, without going through normal channels, without a requirement that they do it, and then specifically choose the Go8 process. That seems unlikely."
44,"@benjaminwittes They wouldn’t need to notify the gang of 8. That process, at least as the law is written, is for covert action notification, though it has sometimes been used for other programs. It’s also the President’s call as to whether to limit that briefing or do it at all."
