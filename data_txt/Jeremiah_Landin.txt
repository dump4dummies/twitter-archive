0,There is a lot of justified anger over the betrayal of our allies. The image and standing of the United States has been harmed due to this monster. We have to start planning how to deal with Turkey going forward and how to repair the damage done. #DumpTrump #TX31 #KurdsBetrayed https://t.co/KjwZf0iX3K

2,I was so happy to join others in the climate strike at southwestern uni. We need candidates who are ready to go to bat for climate change initiatives. #Landin4TX31 #TX31 #ClimateStrike #RepresentationMatters https://t.co/3RsybqJRW5
3,"Pretty decent summary of my campaign, but there is so much more! Feel free to tweet me questions anytime! https://t.co/h0PvvTW1AY via @austinchronicle #TX31 #Landin4TX31"
4,My heart goes out to the people of Midland-Odessa. We cannot accept this anymore. It is time for action. #commonsensegunlaws
5,"For El Paso and Dayton, I said Faith without works is dead. Thoughts and prayers without meaningful gun reform means nothing. I‚Äôm done asking my leaders for action. Step aside and let my generation handle it. We have lived our entire lives with it and we are done accepting it."
6,It was great speaking to y‚Äôall about how representation matters for young people. #TX31 #Landin4TX31 https://t.co/tSMuS57jTU
7,"We must stop this cruelty. For all those on the right that continually said these are not concentration camps, that comparisons to the 1940s were inappropriate; indefinite detention is concentration! If @JudgeCarter won‚Äôt fight this, send me to do it!

8,"Does anyone else want to get to the point in our healthcare system where Denzel Washington in John Q is seen as a deranged mad man, rather than a relatable father fighting injustice in the Medical system?

Elect me and I‚Äôll fight for that. #Landin4TX31

9,I am so honored and excited to be able to share my vision for the district and the nation with y‚Äôall! https://t.co/Q3ium4OXO0
10,It was a good march for the Pride Parade today. Got to meet @PeteButtigieg and share a moment as two young LGBT candidates who are running for federal offices. #Pride #Representation #MayorPete2020 #Landin4TX31 #TX31 https://t.co/zz9Xj0IEI8
11,"Faith without works is dead. Thoughts and prayers without meaningful gun reform means nothing. I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôve lived my whole life with this issue, and I am done with the previous generations‚Äô prayers. Give me your actions, or let me take the action. #TX31 #Dayton #ElPaso"
12,"This is why Immigration courts need to be in their own judiciary. Every time the AG and potus change, lives are destroyed and the system slides further into chaos. If elected I will fight hard for this reform! #TX31 #ImmigrationReformNow #Landin4TX31 https://t.co/hfOwYM0Kr6"
13,RT @RoundRockDems: We're going to have four of the #TX31 congressional candidates speak at our monthly meeting tonight! Bring your friends‚Ä¶
14,"Let me translate: ‚ÄúIf you are a ‚Äògood one‚Äô and wear the red armband, you might be protected and used as a posterboy to justify the crimes we are going to do to your own community.‚Äù This is why we have to fight back. #Vote2020 #VoteBlue #TX31 https://t.co/jySkkxTtjI"
15,"RT @Lawrence: If you‚Äôre in the political news media and this is the 1st time you‚Äôve called Trump a racist, welcome to the enlightenment.‚Ä¶"
16,Why aren‚Äôt you on this list @JudgeCarter ? Is it because you agree with the statements? Silence is complicity. Speaking out is one of the few jobs of a Rep. If you can‚Äôt do that then we need to replace you. #TX31 #Landin4TX31 #CowardlyElephant https://t.co/aiuqA56rs0
17,"Some might say that not all ICE agents are monsters, but it seems the nature of the job attracts those who would have thrived in 1940s Germany. We can abolish ICE. This isnt an org thats been around forever, its a new department. We have lived without it before. #TX31 #BanICE https://t.co/wYMYfknXLZ"
18,"@JudgeCarter  Why are you weak on National Security, weak on Constitutional Order, and weak on Congressional Authority? I encourage #TX31 to Vote to replace a man who can‚Äôt understand why POTUS must come to Congress to engage in wars. #VoteLandin4TX31 https://t.co/HbN9C7lDNL"

21,At what point did Conservatives switch from protecting the environment to actively trying to destroy our ecosystem? At what point does their harmful actions become Criminal Negligence? #ProtectBees #BanNeonicotinoids #TX31 #ProtectFarmers https://t.co/ddmh7BJN3p
22,"This Trump‚Äôs version of the Jacksonian ‚Äúlet them enforce it‚Äù approach. Congress needs to impeach if this question appears despite the SCOTUS ruling. If the precedent set in that SCOTUS can be ignored, their other rulings can be as well (Roe, Gay Marriage, etc.) #TX31 #ImpeachNow https://t.co/FmOr1Huhj0"
23,"On July 5th it is important to remember this often misused quote. Ben warned us against having a strong Executive. Trump isn‚Äôt something new, he is the product of decades of over reliance in the Executive. We need leaders to restore Congressional Authority. #Landin4TX31 #TX31 https://t.co/UqT6kNv2A7"
24,Happy 4th of July from San Gabriel Park. The VDRs out here are doing an amazing job registering voters! #TX31 #VoteBlue #Landin4TX31 https://t.co/wvNS8FskFj
25,It frustrates me that the Right constantly defends the detention centers by saying ‚ÄúIts not as bad as the Holocaust.‚Äù Why does it have to get that bad before you will show outrage? Why can‚Äôt you just join in demanding better treatment for these human beings? #TX31 #Landin4TX31
26,SCOTUS didn't say that Gerrymandering was ok. They said that its a political question that Congress needs to get off its butt and figure out. They told Congress to stop using SCOTUS as the scapegoat for their inaction and ineptitude. #TX31 #Landin4TX31 #SCOTUS
27,Im so tired of the argument that AUMFs are needed so POTUS can quicklyrespond to attacks. Pearl Harbor happened and we had a Decl of War within 2 days. We knew the goals and we didn‚Äôt cede a blank check to the Executive! #TX31 #DemDebate #AUMF
28,What we need is to end AUMF. We have never had a successful AUMF. If we are going to get into armed conflicts then it needs to be issued as a declaration of war by Congress. #DemDebate #TX31
29,@amyklobuchar nice! üëèüëèüëè
30,Is anyone else done with candidates from New York? #Trump #deBlasio #DemDebate #TX31
31,"Let me say that I would raise my hand if I was on that stage. If we can fight for an affordable plan, then I‚Äôd ditch my private insurance. #DemDebate #TX31"
32,"So let me summarize what all these Candidates are afraid to say directly. No those old jobs aren‚Äôt coming back, but we can make new green jobs a reality. Times change and industries die. That‚Äôs capitalism, lets start the transition to Green jobs! #DemDebate #TX31"
33,"Yes! Let‚Äôs finally pass the #ERA! But I should point out that its up to the states to do that at this point, lets put pressure on the final state to do that before the election. #DemDebate #TX31"
34,@BetoORourke nice spanish flex #tx31 #demdebate
35,Well here we go #DemDebate #tx31
36,@GOPLeader kinda ironic given the last decade. Have you talked to @senatemajldr about his playing politics on literally everything? @JudgeCarter whats your thoughts about all the playing politics? #TX31 https://t.co/vIWtCgGOwG
37,"This is why we need Representatives who understand Foreign Policy and what the role of Congress should be. For decades Congress has ceded its check powers to POTUS. I aim to reassert Congressional authority, but I need your help to get there. #TX31 #ChecksandBalances #Landin4TX31 https://t.co/yPQhHJhb8h"
38,Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that this is Democrats crying wolf. The things our government is doing is criminal. We must stand against Concentration Camps in the USA. #NeverAgain #TX31 https://t.co/ddWRAA60bh
39,This is why we need change in Congress. An unwillingness to reassert Congressional authority over the power to make war is why #GOP are weak on National Security. We need our Checks and Balances again! #VoteLandin #TX31 https://t.co/QtTELM6tiJ
40,"Thanks to those who came out for the town hall. It was a great discussion that covered everything from Healthcare, Education, Equal rights, and Term Limits for Congress! I appreciate the insight that y‚Äôall provided in this discussion. #TX31 #Landin4TX31 #FreshWayForward https://t.co/FHKOatGijo"
41,"Im proud to have attended the Georgetown Rally against abortion bans today. Bans only stop safe abortions. If Christians want to stop abortions, they should support bills and candidates that increase sex ed, improve foster care, and increase access to contraception. #StopTheBans https://t.co/7hj0QkcFlD"
