4,"@CCelestres @SmileyForWA We can’t just keep funding and feeding into an issue that gets worse and worse. Really what should happen is a statewide psych ward and rehab center should be put in place. There are 5-7 main causes of homelessness so we should detect the issue individually, then help."
5,"@CCelestres @SmileyForWA Homelessness is a state issue but as us senator, I will hold elected officials accountable. The funds that are given to the state should be placed on hold until a proper plan is put in place. If that plan proves to fail, again funds should be held until a new plan is in place."
6,"@CCelestres @SmileyForWA Hi Chad, saw this pop in my feed. I’m happy to discuss any questions you may have! Thanks for engaging"
7,@BolognaFishMD @Springrrrrrrr @GovInslee Thanks for the support and I agree. It’ll be crazy difficult for any independent to get past the primary but you can’t hit a target if you don’t take a shot. Vote in the August primary! 🙏

9,"@GovInslee predicts “blackouts”, “destruction” and “death” this summer and @PattyMurray has his back! This is ridiculous and emergency powers need to be removed NOW! #NazPaulWA"
10,Complete fear mongering from @PattyMurray and @GovInslee just to satisfy their special-interest group agendas. Manipulating and trying to scare the people to get your way is never okay! So much negativity that I’m sick of! #NazPaulWA https://t.co/QqCIJIdKiy
11,@BolognaFishMD @Springrrrrrrr @GovInslee 🤣 glad I pass the test!
12,"@LightsOnLlama Hi thx for the question! I refer to WA legislators and how WA has dropped significantly as a small-business friendly state, especially when you factor in B&amp;O tax &amp; unemployment tax.  I propose we drop B&amp;O tax &amp; reduce unemployment tax."
13,"When my husband and I started our business we were about to have our 1st baby w/less than $500 in our account. We took a risk, &amp; the American dream came to life for us!  We live in a country where entrepreneurship &amp; small business are valued. I won’t let them take that from us!"

16,"I will put Washingtonians first! ALL Washingtonians. Young, old, parents, singles, blue collar workers, farmers, veterans, business owners, and everyone else in between. I care about Washington and I care about the future my children and yours will be left with. #NazPaulWA"
17,Party puppets are not my idea of representatives that serve the common citizen. Vote for independents that stand against socialism &amp; communism and instead stand up for FREEDOM. Vote #NazPaulWA
18,Time to vote for America first candidates! Not politician first candidates or BigPharma first candidates or Wall Street first candidates. PEOPLE FIRST! #NazPaulWA https://t.co/9UvchP5wlj
19,If you want change stop voting for the people that run under the 2 party system and are CONTROLLED by the 2 party system. They can’t speak their mind or do what they want. They have to stay in line with the establishment. We’re awake now! #NazPaulWA #thinkindependently
20,BigPharma wants to keep people sick. They don’t want to heal and help! WE NEED TO VOTE IN PEOPLE THAT WON’T BE BOUGHT. #NazPaulWA
21,How about we put controls on Wall Street to help inflation? Oh yea that wouldn’t be in the elitist’s best interest! Let’s hurt average Americans instead #NazPaulWA
22,Governments idea of fixing the inflation crisis: reduce social security and Medicare payouts &amp; hike interest rates. Proving they do not care about the everyday American. They care about lining their corrupt pockets and their special interest group pockets. #NazPaulWA
23,Also a big happy freedom day! I love living in a country where equal rights and opportunity is valued! Let’s not forget the amazing privilege we have to be Americans and those who came before to pave that hard road. Honor heritage! https://t.co/s0Eb2vcqrZ
24,"Happy Father’s Day to all the awesome dad’s out there including (but not limited to), my amazing dad, my loving father-in-law, and of course my awesome husband of 10yrs. He is the best father to our 3 boys and support always (not to mention my biggest fan!). ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/94QEPse9C1"

26,@Springrrrrrrr We need to bring the meaning of “budget” back to government. As a business owner and parent I know how to actually budget and cut out useless spending. We need solutions and printing more and more is the worst thing we can do and puts us in a deeper hole!

29,@katrinalp01 100%. It will be a battle but I’m prepared to take it on. A good start would be electing honest politicians that don’t sway legislation with bias for them. I will not be bought. I will serve the people. #NazPaulWA

34,@lozzah79 You’re so beautiful Laura! What a bright future you have ahead! Go girl!
35,@PatrickLyle @mefbama @dawnegray3 Thanks! Another of the few is I don’t believe a child should be forced to carry a pregnancy &amp;deliver. I can’t fathom putting a 12 year old through that. That’s a tremendously horrible situation and a lose lose in my opinion. Both are bad. Ultimately we need to stop the extremes.
36,@mefbama @PatrickLyle @dawnegray3 I’m open to dialogue and sharing my opinion but I don’t feel it’s worth discussing extremely important issues with a contentious individual that likes to make blanket statements. I’m happy to chat further if you truly want to know who I am.
37,@mefbama @PatrickLyle @dawnegray3 Hi Pat I’m not sure if you’ve had others spread false statements about you based off of a partial sentence but I see that you enjoy doing that with me w/out asking me to explain my opinion. That’s okay since that’s the politics game I dove into. #CommunicationIsKey https://t.co/2mCK3x0IHo
38,@loydhogan2 Thanks so much for the support Loyd!
39,I remember back when we were struggling financially and I could only afford to pump $5 in my gas tank just to make it home. It was a little over a gallon at that time. Looks like many Americans are back to that point and I will fight to make necessities affordable again!

48,@RedBeretsM4All @KennyBallentine @DrJoeQJarvis I’m very anti big pharma and I’m for a major healthcare reform. We have to heal America. The healthcare system in the US is setup to keep people sick and drain their pockets. Politicians don’t care and contributing to this.

57,"@chazj9 That’s something, did he sell? We have to put America first! We have to bring back manufacturing jobs. Companies should get tax initiatives to come back."
58,@beatnikdr1 @SmileyForWA Vote independent #NazPaulWA
59,@chazj9 We have to retire Patty. I’m also a big supporter of #termlimits!

62,@MurrayCampaign 2/3 of Congress cashed a BigPharma check in 2020. You are one of them. This is so hypocritical and corrupt. #BigPharma #NazPaulWA #AntiCorruption
63,@chazj9 Have you heard about “Made in China 2025”? That is a big issue we need to take seriously
64,"@chazj9 Over here you have labor unions and the EPA and OSHA— so let’s start with reducing regulations, fees, &amp; taxes, and pursue trade treaties in the best interest of US workers. I have so much more on this so stay tuned…not enough space in these tweets!"
65,@chazj9 No I put baby for a nap! Lol
66,@chazj9 We had container after container stuck at our ports in Seattle for months also.
67,@chazj9 I very much support independence in many aspects—also manufacturing independence. For example the vast majority of medical supplies come from China. What happens if their factory shuts down for 3 months?!
68,@mefbama I don’t think they are. I assume that’s the image since we have only two independent senators that both caucus with democrats. One of them being Bernie sanders. Libertarians are also considered independent candidates. It’s just the image that’s portrayed recently.

73,"This is why independent candidates are ignored by the media and establishment. They know that THE PEOPLE and majority will speak, then they will be exposed and their extreme special-interest groups will lose."
74,"The media and establishment make it seem like we’re in a country of two seriously political extremes. We’re actually not. We have the extremes that scream loud, but most of us (quiet majority) are just normal people that want to live freely and have common sense legislation"

76,@Springrrrrrrr I support the second amendment and common sense gun laws and background checks. I do not support a ban on AR-15’s.

81,I know someone who paid $250 for an antibiotic prescription in the US and later on went to Italy on a trip and needed to get the exact same prescription. They paid 5 euros there! BigPharma passes the cost to US consumers and politicians allow this to keep happening. #bigPharma
82,Nearly 75% of Washingtonians are open to voting for an independent candidate. #NazPaulWA
83,The primaries are setup in favor of the 2party system. Top two go on to the elections in November. The biggest fear to the DC establishment is an independent getting past the primary because they know independents will win and we won’t be bought and controlled. Vote! Let’s go WA!
84,"Unite America institute poll on WA voters: 24% Republican, 33% democrat, and 43% independent. We are the majority! #NazPaulWA the most difficult will be getting past the primary in August. If we do, we will beat Patty Murray. #NazPaulforSenate"
85,@Liberty25777608 @MAGAB07910508 Absolutely not. The biggest threat in the US are the corrupt politicians in DC that want to take away our freedoms. We also have outright socialists serving in government. We need real people that believe in the constitution to stand up and take a stand.

88,"@Scott4WA8 Hi Scott, those here 10yrs plus who have no criminal record and are not reliant on the government, should get an immediate path to residency by gaining a greencard for 5years. Afterwards they can apply for citizenship. The border must be shut completely before this happens."
89,"@MurphysLaw57 @MAGAB07910508 That’s not as easy as it sounds unfortunately.

94,@MAGAB07910508 I think the real problem is extremists that think a 30 year old that came here when they were 5 years old is a criminal just because they don’t have legal residency. That is unAmerican.
95,@WayneWaller19 Out of curiosity did you help them with a work visa of some sort? Are you an employer? Thanks for engaging btw 👍
96,@WayneWaller19 Well that’s very nice of you. If they qualified for asylum or had an immediate relative that was a citizen or had a higher education and could apply for the LIFE Act that would have worked but there are millions of people here that don’t have those options.
97,"@SickofGOPswamp Like I said, our establishment promotes this in droves. I’m for securing our border immediately but we have to fix the problem that has been enabled for 30 years plus. Real solutions. Saying to send the millions of people back is not going to fly and is unproductive speech."
98,@SickofGOPswamp https://t.co/UhFaE55MsQ
99,@SickofGOPswamp Yes gas prices are definitely a huge problem. My tweet was specific to immigration but we have many real issues that need solutions. I unfortunately heard a rumor we may hit $10/gal.
