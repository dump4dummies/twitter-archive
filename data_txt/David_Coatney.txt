Frederick Douglass stated, ""if Black people were to be really free, they must have the Cartridge box, the Jury box, and the Ballot box to protect them.”"
24,The history of gun control in this country is rooted in bigotry and racism. The Black Codes were used by Southern States to utilize racial and economic restrictions to make it illegal for minorities to possess firearms. The right to bear arms is indispensable to black equality. https://t.co/W2zPYzV5Xi

55,2/2 Rolling back patent laws and allowing competition in the marketplace would result in less expensive drugs. Less expensive drugs means less expensive healthcare which means less expensive insurance.
56,1/2- It’s time to address the cost of prescription drugs. Current patent protection laws are geared at allowing Big Pharma to operate w/o competition. These laws do not protect the consumer and they encourage drug companies to hike rates far beyond what they should be. #Extortion

75,@kt_kevinthomas @JudgeBobOrr @WendyforWNC That would depend on which side I choose to caucus with. I honestly haven't decided that yet. I would probably wait to see where the chips fall and caucus where I feel I can be of the most benefit to the district.
76,@MapManDave @JudgeBobOrr @WendyforWNC I also support the latter. I don't believe voter access and voter integrity should be treated as a false dichotomy. Both are achievable. I think a system that toughens the penalties for those who commit fraud is preferable to potentially turning away eligible voters
77,"@MapManDave @JudgeBobOrr @WendyforWNC I support bodily autonomy in all situations. I believe that's a conversation women should have with their doctor, not their politician."
78,"@JudgeBobOrr @WendyforWNC I understand and agree.  For what it's worth, I'm a lifelong UNA (recently turned 3rd party candidate), and I'll be on your Nov ballot. Unlike most in the GOP, I'll sit down with Democrats and find common ground to work together. I will do the same with Republicans."
79,@one_Punchy @beinlibertarian Correct. That idea first appeared in a fictional book by Washington Irving in 1828. The earth being round was universally accepted by scholars during and long before the time of Columbus.
80,"When casting your vote tomorrow, remember to ask yourself whether this person will put the interests of their constituents above their own personal interests. Character matters. I'll be on the Nov ballot regardless, but let's get quality candidates from all parties!"

82,"7) Rollback Trump-era tariffs on steel, lumber, and other items. Your friendly reminder: A tariff is a tax, and we’re the ones that pay that in the form of higher prices."
83,6) Drive down the costs of goods by reducing the tax burden on manufacturers.
84,5) Expand trade diversification by nearshoring where it’s feasible. This will create less dependency on China while also easing some of our supply issues.
85,"4) Drive down energy costs through diversification and less foreign dependency. This will require a combination of further development in Solar, pipelines, and nuclear energy."
86,"3) Balanced Budget Amendment- Government expenditures should be dictated by projected receipts. It’s time to turn the money printer off. The increase in money supply is the root cause of inflation, and it devalues our currency over time."
87,2) Fundamentally reduce healthcare costs by eliminating Patent Protections geared at allowing Big Pharma to operate w/o competition. Allowing competition into the marketplace will lead to a reduction in pharmaceutical costs. This results in less expensive healthcare &amp; insurance.
88,"1) Encourage natural and sustainable wage growth. The FairTax will replace the Payroll Tax, allowing funds already set aside for payroll (and previously dedicated to the payroll tax) to go directly to the employee in the form of higher wages."
