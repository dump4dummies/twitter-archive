56,"Wherein Zionists get to claim a single ethno-religion, the diverse ethnicities of Palestine and the diverse religions they practice (in harmony up until European colonization) are treated as second class citizens. So sharing a ""wife swap"" and comparing cuisines is ❌problematic❌"
57,(aka Orientalism)
58,Not to mention the fact that Europeans like to claim brown folks from the middle east and south Asia are white when it's convenient
59,"Let's acknowledge the fact that the Zionist state of Israel only welcomes white and middle eastern Jews, and remember what they did to Ethiopian Jews"
60,"Like I'm literally descended from Iraqi (Basra) Jews and possibly Iranian Jews (Shiraz) but you know, I still acknowledge the inherent white supremacy in a colonizer Zionist state. https://t.co/RrddSvMGyG"
61,"Like you don't get to share self-deprecating in-humor about Arabs if you're not Arab, just saying, and being Jewish doesn't mean you get to make fun of Arabs -- you ain't us"
62,This was sent along with a post about a hairy foot and different Arab nationalities not claiming it as their own. From a wypipo. Sounds about White.
63,"Apparently I'm antisemitic because I called a friend on posting a Zionist post that is basically a ""both sides"" comparison of Israeli and Palestinian people. It was literally posted by ""IrishforIsraelAlways"" and the guy sharing it is White"
