0,@AlbertLee2020 Bonamici and Earl just cruised through the primary. They probably didn’t even bother to spend any money. It’s not that they are corporate Democrats. Their base keeps voting them back in and by a large margin.
1,"Running for office has allowed me to meet many outstanding candidates running for local, state, and federal seats. I am honored to have met @RJ4oregon. I believe under his watch, his district and our state will flourish behind imagination. Vote for RJ on May 17th! 🇺🇸"
2,"@JoAnnLChateau Hi @JoAnnLChateau,
Yes, you are correct. Our campaign rejects any corporate PAC money. Our campaign is 100% grassroots. Win or lose, the fight continues, and we will not stop. Thank you for reaching out! 😊"
3,Thank you to the League of Minority Voters for inviting me to share my platform along with the other candidates in the state. https://t.co/RlmxIQsyC4
4,Thank you @ballotpedia for allowing me to share my platform and vision for Oregon 6th congressional district.
5,"@HeidiBriones If Donald can declare bankruptcy and not pay back his loan, why can’t we? 😂🤷🏻‍♂️"

9,@HeidiBriones Facts!
10,"@HeidiBriones Sad, we always put ourselves down instead of uplifting the community. Oh well, we can’t win every battle."
11,"@HeidiBriones Remember the movie, Selena? “You’re either too Mexican for the Americans or too American for the Mexicans.”"
12,@HeidiBriones We have white Latinos now? 🤷🏻‍♂️
13,@JonMunitz Facts
14,@SiebeforORD1 Some places do charge for testing and vaccines. Plenty of spots that provide the service for free. Walgreens just messed up or something.
15,@HeidiBriones 81 years old! She has to go. Pass the torch on to our new leaders.
16,No filter! https://t.co/wfd5grmjxk
17,@HeidiBriones 🤦🏻‍♂️. Russian bots
18,@HeidiBriones Who did that?
19,"""You can't love your country only when you win.""- Biden"
20,"@SiebeforORD1 @RepBonamici Ahh, yes! We have no one to blame but ourselves, who keep voting her in every two years."
21,"@SiebeforORD1 @RepBonamici I thought she said, “take out a loan?”"
22,@HeidiBriones I’ll wait to see his actual tax returns. 😝
23,@HeidiBriones https://t.co/PiafEELhoo
24,@Jon_Munitz She’s the worst. Which is why she decided not to run for re-election. Wouldn’t surprise me she gets a FT job at Fox News.
25,"@HeidiBriones I don’t agree with you, but why would I unfollow you friend, our difference of opinion makes up stronger. 💪🏼"
26,"@HeidiBriones I’m confused, you’re saying he is not guilty because of the drama that unfolded in the courthouse or he is guilty of murder as clear as day? Tulsi- 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
27,@HeidiBriones Damn. Talk about anger issues. 🤷🏻‍♂️
28,@HeidiBriones Her name is GIF- haha.
29,@HeidiBriones That’s what they say now. 🤷🏻‍♂️
30,@HeidiBriones https://t.co/vKgw4h0NwG
31,@HeidiBriones Doesn’t the Senate have a dress code?
32,@HeidiBriones They’re watching you. 😅✌🏼
33,@DavidKimForCA 🇺🇸
34,@tellison74 https://t.co/Ngp7vtXhUY
35,@JaronKrause 😂😂😂.
36,@DrJasonJohnson @TiffanyDCross $380 for Mignon. The piece piece of meat better talk to me on the way down. 🤦🏻‍♂️
37,@HeidiBriones Her account wasn’t shut down for “simply speaking” out against mandates. She went on to falsely state Covid -19 isn’t deadly or harmful. To numbers speak for itself domestically and across the globe.
38,"@HeidiBriones He became popular while debating with Democrats. No hidden secret. His policy was rejected in one of the biggest progressive cities in our country. Don’t get me wrong, I like the guy, but he’s trying too hard to become a star overnight. I still love you! 💙"
39,https://t.co/yRopyRO3YM
40,"Yang plans to launch a third party either in 2022 or 2024. I support more parties. However, he doesn’t deserve any more spotlight under the Democrats during the next presidential election. Exit Yang! ✌🏼@HeidiBriones"
41,"@SiebeforORD1 Thank you for speaking up, Amanda! 💙"
42,@HeidiBriones Nothing wrong with that. 😎
43,@HeidiBriones @NMcKeonOfficial 😘 https://t.co/o0s8aXhko8
44,@HeidiBriones Amen
45,@JonMunitz 🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️
46,@HeidiBriones 🤪
47,"@candaceforpdx Looks like a great opportunity. Hope to see your name on the ballot next year, Candace. 😊"
48,Cuba 🇨🇺💔
49,@HeidiBriones 😁
50,"@MRamosDC Stay safe, my friend !"
51,"@HeidiBriones Welcome back, friend! 💙"
52,"@JonMunitz Most people are incurring interest as credit card companies are providing “relief.” Cancel all interest in credit cards and put a freeze on changes to the people's credit report/ score. Credit is an important factor we must address, the consequences will be a disaster."
53,@JonMunitz Biden will win PA and WI. He needs Florida if he losses his home state of PA. AZ will put him over 300.
54,"Donald Trump appointing three Supreme Court justices was my biggest fear. What’s worse, he can potentially nominate a fourth if he is re-elected. We are now seeing the full effects of the 2016 election. “Lesser of two evil”- tarnish Democracy."
55,@JonMunitz Fuck 2020
56,"@JonMunitz His revolution wasn’t his, to begin with, if he can’t control his audience. He opened up a pandora box and doesn’t know how to close it. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
57,"@JonMunitz A little humor, God knows we need it! 😂"
58,"@JonMunitz Right, including have Bernie supporters vote for her instead of Gary Johnson, a Libertarian and opposite of Bernie's platform. Comey interferences and Putin. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
59,@JonMunitz 🙋🏻‍♂️
60,"@RealCandaceO, by the way, was the book signing worth selling out your people? 💵"
61,"@RealCandaceO instead of trashing your community, why not invest and enhance your community. Your attacks on celebs seem more like jealously. I guess you didn’t learn from @TomiLahren when she tried attacking @iamcardib https://t.co/72qCQiul3q"
62,Thank you President @JoeBiden https://t.co/vcV6r8puzy
63,"@JonMunitz Live for the moment, my friend. I’m here for you if you need anything! 🌎🌎"
64,"@JonMunitz Unfortunately, society and our social problems do not have patience. You deciding to run in 2024 doesn’t mean you don’t have patience; instead, you’re tired of waiting for leadership from our government leaders—both state and federal."
65,"I was watching earlier, “Knockdown the House.” Still, to this day, I’m inspired, and I do want to run again. I thought of people who want to bridge the division and thought of you @HeidiBriones. It’ll be an honor to represent the state of Oregon alongside you! 2022! 🇺🇸"
66,"@JonMunitz 2026 is too far my friend, the world needs you now! 🌎"
67,"@JonMunitz She is right, though. Republicans play dirty and get away with so much. Democrats are soft and give in. A little backbone wouldn’t hurt this year!"
68,"@NelNieves @HeidiBriones @lsthart @DNC Warning delegate doesn't automatically award you a spot on the DNC, especially if you are against you're own party."
69,"@HeidiBriones Why would they invite her when she has attacked the Dem party for the last four years, attacked Obama, and her entire field of the nominee for the Democrats! She is a division! 🤷🏻‍♂️. Her attack on HRC was weak and lacked leadership."
70,@JonMunitz 🙋🏻‍♂️. I’m back.
71,@HeidiBriones You’re running again? 🎊🎉🙌🏼
72,@JonMunitz Kamala! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
73,@SiebeforORD1 Have you booked your ticket?
74,@SiebeforORD1 @CoriBush I fricken love her!
75,@HeidiBriones Every day!
76,@HeidiBriones Biden is in a good position. He needs to keep talking about healing the nation and proposing his economic plan. Can’t wait for Election Day!
77,@HeidiBriones https://t.co/3u9beUgQoH
78,@HeidiBriones 💙💙💙
79,@HeidiBriones #TeamBiden 2020. 😁
80,@HeidiBriones Love it! 💙💙🙌🏼
81,Kanye..... 🤦🏻‍♂️
82,@JonMunitz “This has been a paid advertisement by the Trump Campaign for Trump 2020. We now return you to your regular campaign season” 🇺🇸
83,@HeidiBriones There is hope after all 🤷🏻‍♂️
84,@HeidiBriones He needs a hug!
85,@HeidiBriones Tomi can’t see pass 2 feet. She spews massive lies with no hard evidence to back it up. South Dakota is calling you Tomi!
86,@HeidiBriones ✌🏼
87,"@jonmunitz She wasn’t perfect, but I genuinely believe under her leadership, no one would have been left behind during COVID 19. Money would have been pumped into people's pockets since day 1, not weeks or months later."
88,"@jonmunitz Hillary did her best. Her 2008 presidential race was the icing on the cake for multiple candidates across the country to run. Call me bias, but if it wasn’t for her, I do not think we would have seen so many women run this year."
89,@HeidiBriones I’m jealous lol
90,"@HeidiBriones Let’s allow Biden to inspire us through his administration, VP pick, Supreme Court pick, and restoring the soul into all Americans. It may not be inspiring seeing another older, white man, but it is sure a hell of a start and better than Trump!"
91,@HeidiBriones @hellseathinks I haven’t qualified for jack! So much for the CARES ACT! 💔
92,"@HeidiBriones Or, “name that city that isn’t in your district, but we still want to ask cause it’s a gotcha question!” 🤬"
93,@HeidiBriones Better than “what is your experience.” 😂🤦🏻‍♂️. I will never forget those jerks! 😤
94,@HeidiBriones @AndrewYang Love your long hair! 😁
95,Congratulations @AOC. You’re still inspiring millions across the country!💪🏼🇺🇸
96,@jonmunitz Deja Vu 🤦🏻‍♂️. (Sigh)
97,"@HeidiBriones Weren't the Tea Party burning the American flag in 2010 because they hated Obama? Isn't wearing any apparel with the American flag illegal? If so, people do that all the time. Shouldn’t that be illegal? He needs to stop cherry picking issues. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
98,@MyLifeIsMunitz Preach Jon!
