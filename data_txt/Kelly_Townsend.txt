3,@forward4US Arizona DPS does not mess around. You had people trying to break in and you had the entire Senate within.  Choices have consequences and I am very grateful for our men and women who protected us. Don’t want to get gassed? Don’t try breaking in the Senate building with us inside.

15,@BybeeLt Lololol good eyes
16,@mjbricka That was early on sweetheart.  FF a bit.
17,"So I needed to come down and see for myself with my own eyes what they have done to our memorials.I wish I could describe the deep anger, but I will just say that it is one of those things you set aside and move forward because we are winning. #J24 https://t.co/OzrriW6Lns"
18,"Unshaken: so proud of our State.  Nothing stops us from moving forward. We passed ESA for all, got the people’s work done and pressed on with the joy of freedom inherited from our Founders.  AOC was terrified, we were enjoying each other on our last night of session.  #AZRocks! https://t.co/oHunAJILjP"
19,"It was a surreal feeling when we were in the basement, and I began taking pictures of everyone for inventory in case they caught the building on fire with us down there. Obviously it wasn’t that bad but in the moment we did not know.  This is the moment that will stay with me."
20,"@AZ_Turned_BLUE @AOC Who said I was scared? I said the children were solving a fear, we were taking care of the situation. This is Arizona, after all."

24,@LorraineEMT @Arizona_DPS I am so sorry I missed this.
25,"We were in the middle of a vote on the expansion of ESA for all so that parents may take their child to the school of their choice when protesters started attempting to kick in the doors. Was this really an attempt to stop that vote more than a #RvW protest? Did not work, though."
26,"I cannot thank @Arizona_DPS enough.  You were patient, yet acted when needed.  God bless you guys! https://t.co/SYhdd8fP3w"

28,@mjbricka What parent brought their kid to a protest like this that had promised violence?
29,"Everyone is okay, and we are finishing our work. https://t.co/Y4ijQkaN2U"
30,"Appalling to hear some Democrats defending those outside trying to break the glass and breach security.  “This is a public building, and they wouldn’t let them in.” However another Democrat mad as heck for them scaring the children in the building."
31,We are currently there being held hostage inside the Senate building due to members of the public trying to breach our security. We smell teargas and the children of one of the members are in the office sobbing with fear.  I expect a J24 committee to be created immediately.
32,@janet_delear @AZGOP @AZHouseGOP @AZSenateGOP @NancyBarto @StevenTylerAZ @ThatParentP4P @JMFILLMORE You are WRONG.  The bill had a provision to revert to the statehood law if Roe was overturned.

41,@BcoleBrad I said it was a Noble issue. But right now the country is burning down and she did not prioritize that at all.
42,"Well you can call it peanuts, but it’s a heck of a lot more for election security than what my opponent asked for which was zero. Instead she asked for bodies in the forest for search and rescue. While noble, does nothing for our elections. https://t.co/oRnbgiPNyA"

44,This is no secret and had they asked me I would’ve happily given them a copy. We based our action off of the 1960 situation in Hawaii while the election results were in question and they sent an alternate slate which ultimately was used. I am honored to have been part of this. https://t.co/Cv8HwJAH9B
45,@eelfood Sorry that’s not defensive or something of any feet. Just short into the point because I am working on six hours asleep in the last 72 hours. No offense.
46,"@HandymanPatriot @ApacheJctMAGA I got quite a bit for election reform, we are building the state guard, we have a parent liaison at the ombudsman‘s office for ESA’s, and we are going to clean up the voter rolls. Something no one has been able to get done at this point but with my request it will be."
47,@DennyZ25153949 Very legitimate concern. That’s why I worked very hard to put into the budget what was constitutional and improper form so that it would be secure. We did that and were successful. I don’t like a lot of things in the budget but we are in an election crisis.
48,"@HandymanPatriot @ApacheJctMAGA Well handy, if I could do that by myself we would’ve gotten rid of those along time ago."
49,A statement vote of no in a time of election crisis is a failure.
50,@eelfood I didn’t need to explain my yes vote so there’s no video of me explaining it.
51,@DennyZ25153949 The election measures that I passed had an appropriation with them so it’s in constitutional and proper form and will not be struck down in court. Wendy sat on her laurels while I found out what was possible and got it done. That’s the difference between the two of us.
52,@ApacheJctMAGA You go past your self on the back with an empty hand when it comes to elections. Our country is at stake and I will do whatever is necessary to fix elections process while you go and Crow about getting nothing. Good day.
53,"@NorthrupCm Refer you to my last Tweet. Read, repeat."

55,Everyone tune into @SCOTUSblog Tyo catch the supreme Court opinions that will be released in about 15 minutes or so.
56,@NorthrupCm OK then I expect you to tell the same thing to all the others who did do the same tweets. Almost all of them were Democrats. Let me know and tag me please. Just click on the hashtag and you’ll see
57,@Rockinthe60z The Hollywood thing was a completely different bill which I voted no on. Right now the country needs us to fix elections and this was the only way in Arizona due to the make up of the legislature. I had to choose between nothing in that. Big step forward regarding elections.
58,@JulieAb99208453 The rental tax relief is coming.
59,"@HandymanPatriot If I were able to do it on my own, those would be gone. Wendy &amp; Michelle voted to keep 2020 rules. This bill has a big appropriation to secure the Dropboxes like an ATM machine that I asked for. That is a huge step forward. I would rather get rid of them but 2020 rules is not ok."
60,"@HandymanPatriot Nope, true election reform done.  Not everything but a huge win for us.  Wendy’s successes?  Zero."
61,@ApacheJctMAGA My 100% focus was on the asks that I requested which was mostly Elections. We couldn’t get anything done with regular bills so this was the only way to get as much done as possible. I couldn’t control how the rest  Caucus voted but I could control what I asked for. Voter rolls
62,@Fr33domLvr2 What we needed to do and promised her constituents is that we would take care of elections. She could have done that and she didn’t.  She lost except to say she voted her principles. That’s great but what did she do for Elections? We don’t have time for virtue signaling.
63,@ApacheJctMAGA That budget passed regardless. With Wendy’s strategy we would walk away with nothing in the way of election reform. All she gets to say is she held her principles. At least I was able to bring serious reform to the voter rolls which is what we need. She lost her battle bigly.
64,@ApacheJctMAGA I voted NO on that bill.  We need election reform at all costs. I am not the Senate president so I do not have control over most of this but what I do have control over is getting as much election reform done as possible so that we will still be a country!  1/2
65,"@Fr33domLvr2 Hmmm, wonder who this might be."
66,"@NorthrupCm No, it is opinion. And I will continue to participate in the tradition."
67,"@NorthrupCm It is a Legislative tradition to post #StartYourOwnRumor posts during budget.  But once again, glad to be of service to your need to attack.  #sublimate"
68,"To my knowledge and per Appropriations, she asked for no election reform in this budget, whatsoever."
69,"We just passed the budget feed bill that includes my budget asks for voter roll clean up, election quality control officers at the auditor General’s office to spot check election officials’ compliance with State law, and building the State guard.

79,@BrotatoMark Unfortunately true.
80,"Early ballots will be mailed out July 6. I recommend you do not mail them, nor put them into a dropbox but to hand-deliver them and observe your ballot being tabulated in front of you, provided your county allows for that. Otherwise vote in person on the day of Aug 2nd."
81,@CannConActual @HeatWall1 @UsInformed @WendyRogersAZ Agreed
82,@JulieAb99208453 @azbrett Exactly where am I refusing to see election fraud? I am the first elected official to call for an audit a month before any other had the courage to come out and say so and I have been saying it ever since. Where did you get the idea that I am an election fraud denier?
83,@LoriBarlow13 @RinoSlayers Yes.
84,"@ApacheJctMAGA @chalitasrose And by the way, that was said with all sincerity. If you saw it through the lens of sarcasm, I cannot help that. And I am very glad that he does see us."
