8,And stockholders ensure a private bank is held accountable. Are you suggesting that we pay regulators to supervise and ensure that the banks stay on mission? This seems incredibly misguided and naive.
9,The under lying assumption that a public bank will do more good than a private one fails to account for human bias. And when they do wrong how will you measure their performance and hold them accountable. Profit isn't about greed. It is about a return on investment.
