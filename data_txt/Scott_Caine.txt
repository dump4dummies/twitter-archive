4,"I will be on @newsmax today at 11:20am ET to discuss China, an important component of my Flight Plan for Relaunching America's Economy. Tune in here: https://t.co/7omLeVXv8g"
5,"I will be a panelist on ""National Report"" @newsmax at 11:30am ET tomorrow to discuss China. Holding China accountable starts with tapping into America's ingenuity and becoming a leader in 5G, ensuring #TikTok comes under American ownership, and returning supply chains to the US."
6,@Fla_Pol thank you for your article about our #FlightPlan for Relaunching America's Economy. Washington needs bold leadership. https://t.co/ymkvSWOkGw
7,"The youth of America are our most vital resource and to leave them prey to the Chinese Communist Party's #TikTok is unconscionable. @LouDobbs

11,"The Chinese Communist Party controls thought and action in China through TikTok data and now they have an opportunity to take their propaganda to the world through apps like TikTok. Beware! #CCP #China @LouDobbs

@seanhannity"
12,"#TikTok is not social media, it is an AI algorithm that is used to control what you see, in an attempt at influencing what you believe."
13,This is further bolstered by Trump's sale of brand new F-16s to Taiwan in late 2019. It's good to see @realDonaldTrump holding #China accountable. I have done so my entire career in the USAF and I intend to do so as a Congressman.
14,"This is a significant move by the Trump Administration. After HK, Taiwan is the next domino to fall to China's creep. Unlike the Obama administration, Trump set Taiwan as the red line and he doesn’t intend to let China cross it. https://t.co/7uj98LIvmo"
15,It's very difficult to stand by and defend China as they continue cracking down on dissidents in Hong Kong. #China #CCP @LouDobbs @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
16,‘Free Speech’ suppression has officially moved to Hong Kong. Jimmy Lai’s arrest is a Clear Warning that Communist China is serious about suppressing Free Speech. This is a strong &amp; intentional warning against those who are pro-Democracy.
17,I support President Trump fully in his executive action to ban TikTok from operating within 45 days -- this is the BOLD LEADERSHIP we need on a national level.
18,@TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @marklevinshow
19,Time's up for #TikTok. History will look back &amp; see the election of @realDonaldTrump as the moment America confronted China &amp; won the next century. Thanks @POTUS https://t.co/4hqHfamR3v #ThursdayThoughts
20,"Americans MUST be aware of the Chinese Communist Party's data-mining practices. Was pleased to join @newsmax this morning to discuss @TikTok, @SenFeinstein, and the Chinese Communist Party. #CCPChina You can view my appearance here: https://t.co/8Bsr9cD4eF"
21,"Will the 21st century be the American Century or the Chinese Century?

22,I will be on @CBSNews at 1:45pm ET today to discuss the SpaceX/NASA splashdown. Tune in here: https://t.co/VBF1JUuaGy
23,"Fighter Pilot. Vice Commander. Republican, ALWAYS! @Florida_Today @FloridaPolitic"
24,I was interviewed this morning on @NBC's @NBCLX. I spoke about the consulate closures and shared my vision for what it will take to hold China accountable. https://t.co/gnQYmI38us
25,"The #Chengdu consulate is geographically the furthest West consulate, keeping an eye on #Tibet, focusing on human rights concerns. The closures of the consulates in #Houston and Chengdu are a shot across the bow that will likely spark dialogue and not further escalation."
26,I will be on @NBCLX at 8:30 ET to discuss consulate closures in China and the United States. https://t.co/pcZ0CFQjse
27,Everyone knows the Democrats are simply attacking and shaming Republicans and @realDonaldTrump while appeasing China and dividing our country. I call on Congressman Posey to immediately remove his name from this obvious Democrat attack on our President. https://t.co/6yavRcCGBm
28,The CCP controls thought and action in #China through data like this and now they have an opportunity to take their propaganda to the world through apps like @tiktok_us. @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
29,@tiktok_us has 800 million users worldwide. We need to be leery of anything China-based because they’re always susceptible to the CCP especially when they can have control of the algorithm. @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
30,New reporting shows that TikTok is delivering data to China. This is a real world implication of China’s data-mining of Americans. Thank you @UKZak for highlighting this from @ProtonMail  https://t.co/Nrk6KigwyX
31,"RT @CaineCongress: I'll be on ""American Agenda"" with @BobSellersTV on @newsmax at 2:30 ET today to discuss the recent consulate closures in…"
32,"I'll be on ""American Agenda"" with @BobSellersTV on @newsmax at 2:30 ET today to discuss the recent consulate closures in China and the USA."
33,"In regards to China, President Trump has taken the bold step of backing up strong rhetoric with action here at home."
34,I took the time to complete @Ballotpedia's candidate survey to share my vision and goals. You'll be able to see the responses on my profile shortly.
35,"Historically, the US has relied on nothing stronger than sharp language; that approach hasn’t worked and China has simply continued to escalate its bad behavior."
36,"The combination of Human Rights violations, Covid-19 pandemic, Hong Kong crackdown, imperialistic takeover of the South China Sea, and theft of Intellectual Property has brought into focus a requirement to finally hold China accountable for its actions."
37,These consulates are hubs for #China to export Anti-American rhetoric and to extract US Intellectual Property. #HoustonConsulate @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity
38,"With the UK’s recent actions as a statement against #China, the US is showing strong support for our closest ally. Closing one of China’s 5 Consulates in the US is a shot across the bow that the behavior will no longer be tolerated. #Houston @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity"
39,The US and the UK working in tandem could be exactly what the world needs to hold China accountable. The simple fact is that @realDonaldTrump is doing what he said he would do: bringing other Western leaders with him.
40,This is great news and a great first step in blunting China's influence from spreading. Our Allies are starting to wake up to the fact that China is not their friend. https://t.co/6c8peXL2AY
41,"As a new fighter pilot, I was given the callsign Citizen. But it's become more to me than just a way to get my attention. https://t.co/euXL3UFLEm"
42,"Had Huawei expanded beyond Western Europe and into Great Britain, the People's Liberation Army would have had access to all of the intelligence our allies depend on. This is a fight we must continue to win."
43,"The UK's decision to ban China’s #Huawei from 5G networks is a welcome move by our ally. When we look at Huawei, we must realize they're nothing less than a key asset of China's Communist Party in their effort to become the world's superpower."
44,The US education system needs to give parents and students more choices to keep up with the world and get our economy back on track. A free people should not have options removed by governmental entities acting like authoritarians.
45,"China would love for US kids to fall a full year behind in school because we didn’t offer viable education options this fall. We need in-person, virtual, and voucher education options."
46,We are just now waking up to the fact that we are in a Cold War with China… China has known it all along!
47,"COVID-19 has refocused the West’s attention on China; however, China has been in a form of Long Insurgent War with the West for 40 years. People are just now waking up to it."
48,"Just as in Mao’s Long March, the Communist Party of China has been working on the fringes to increase their influence around the world. This is a classic insurgent campaign. Instead of taking on a power face-to-face, you do it where you can find advantage in the shadows."
49,"It was great to meet with Scot Wilke the owner of Wilke's 14 Bones, as well as his friend Tom Collins. 14 Bones indeed serves great BBQ but like the rest of America, this business has had to adapt to these unprecedented times. Let's get back to work and #ReopenAmerica! https://t.co/KvgYCkKNu0"
