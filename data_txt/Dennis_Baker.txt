9,4/4 They wanted to override the will of the people and disregard the votes of 81 million people.
10,"3/4 In the weeks leading up to January 6th and then on that day, Trump and his allies showed they
were not people who keep their word. Senator James Lankford was one of them. It is not overly
dramatic to say that this was an attack on voting rights and the electoral process."
11,"2/4 That‚Äôs why I spent 23 years as an FBI Special Agent focusing on counterterrorism efforts to keep Americans safe. For some people though, the oath of office is just a bunch of pretty words."
12,"1/4 The rule of law exists only if people respect it. Doing so is especially important for people who have sworn to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. I took that oath and considered upholding it to be a sacred responsibility.

13,2/2 You will never have to worry about me going back on my word and promoting myself or my interests over our Constitution.

20,3/3 Sending Democrats like me to the Senate is the only way to prevent this from happening.
21,2/3 Republicans in the Senate plan to target Medicare and Social Security for cuts if they win the Senate in November. Over 50% of our veterans use Medicare in addition to their VA insurance and cutting it would put an additional burden on people who‚Äôve already given enough.
22,"1/3 Oklahoma has more veterans per capita than any other state and we are rightfully proud of our military tradition. Those who choose to go into the armed services give up a great deal for the sake of their country.
