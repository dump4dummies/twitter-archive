52,"It’s adorable how Joe Biden believes 9mm (the most popular handgun cartridge in the world) is “high power”.  Even the .223 rifle is about 3x more powerful.   There’s room for some background check improvements, but banning 9mm, as he proposes, is absurd."

80,It’s ok to be skeptical about our military involvement (increasingly direct and aggressive) in Ukraine. @POTUS clearly isn’t capable of understanding the risks of putting $40B more in lethal weapons into an already very dangerous regional war.
