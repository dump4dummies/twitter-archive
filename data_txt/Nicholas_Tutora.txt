1,@CassandraRules I don’t think she’s getting a second date.
2,@AyannaPressley The black population would be almost double if not for abortion. That would give them more political power. Why do you want to destroy the people you claim to care about?
3,@disclosetv That’s gross.
4,@hodgetwins It was because of pronouns.
5,@stillgray Demonic possession brought to you by the people at Twitter maker of fine snack items!
6,@browneyegirl400 Sick.
7,@RepMTG You are correct.
8,@isabellarileyus Do any men actually want to have sex with these women? An end to hookup culture will make society that much better.
9,@RadicalRoy1 G-d works in mysterious ways.
10,@SaraGonzalesTX @isabellarileyus Does some men actually want to have sex with these women?
11,@browneyegirl400 Highly educated.

13,@AOC Shhh!
14,@pnjaban @daviddaleiden It is a great day. A day to celebrate.
15,"@hrin_mike @lavern_spicer She certainly doesn’t represent her constituents, which if I’m not mistaken is her job!"

24,@kittenhawk1 @Woody40199703 @RepAndyBiggsAZ You’re delusional. It’s sad.
25,@RepMTG This very well could be the end of the republic.
26,@Woody40199703 @kittenhawk1 @RepAndyBiggsAZ Perversion is not worthy of respect.

28,"@pnjaban As a pharmacist I say it must be made  illegal. And as a basic comment, genders that require hormone therapy and surgery cannot by definition be naturally occurring."
29,@RealDante12 The reason behind the whole movement.
30,@stclairashley If this law passes it’s the end of the republic.
31,"@AyannaPressley What about this? When will you condemn it? Oh, wait you said there needs to be unrest in the streets. https://t.co/UXYhogZbwX"
32,@RepLizCheney You’re history.
33,"@kittenhawk1 @RepAndyBiggsAZ XX or XY. These are the choices. So you’re saying everybody in the west and China and all over the world since the beginning of human time had it wrong when it comes to gender?Please, don’t be ridiculous and waste your time with silly things."
34,@kittenhawk1 @RepAndyBiggsAZ Not so. Look deeper you’ll find it represents nothing like today’s transgenderism. There are 2 genders it has been true since the beginning of time &amp; will remain that way.
35,@kittenhawk1 @RepAndyBiggsAZ Ludicrous.
36,@RealDante12 Yup.
37,@AyannaPressley Perhaps you should promote men having respect for women &amp; encourage woman not to promote their own sexual exploitation. Or is this just acceptable and elevating of the human condition? Maybe if your agenda didn’t end in $7 a gallon gas these women wouldn’t need prostitution https://t.co/96fA4WgaWi
38,@RealDante12 He took to much off the top. My sideburns are uneven.
39,@RepAndyBiggsAZ All this pronoun nonsense. They are the ones misgendering not us. There are 2 genders.

42,@AyannaPressley Let’s celebrate all the white Union soldier who gave their lives so black people could be free. I’m glad you celebrate the holiday that honors straight white men.
43,"@AyannaPressley Well, at least that explains why you’re so angry. Fatherless homes is the main cause for the problems the black community face. Second, to referring woman as hoes and B’s. https://t.co/0f0phqTzvI"
44,@AyannaPressley @JoyAnnReid @TiffanyDCross What’s with the wigs? Seems a bit like cultural appropriation to me?

66,"@KeithOlbermann In America we hear witnesses from both sides, in fascist America one sided show trials are enough."
67,@LeeCWest @AyannaPressley All races. Every race has been slaves to other races at one time or another. White Europeans were held as slaves in Africa. Slavery was started in the ancient empires of Persia slavery still happens today in Libya. Stop with the selective outrage. The Bible talks about slavery.

75,"@AyannaPressley Juneteenth, the day white men freed the last of the slaves. 350,000 white union soldiers gave their lives to free black people. It nice to finally have a holiday to acknowledge their ultimate sacrifice. No other race has ever laid down their lives to free another race."
76,"@KeithOlbermann J6 hearings. Oh wait, we all know that’s a scam."
77,@AyannaPressley * to free another race.
78,@pnjaban It’s horrific. Thank you for fighting against it.
79,"@50nsexy2014 @AyannaPressley @POTUS All the areas that are supposedly examples of these racial based income inequality theories are run by democrats and have been for over 50 years. You think they’d come up with some kind of answer? Wait, everyone was economically better under Trump. Record high #’s for blacks."
80,@50nsexy2014 @AyannaPressley @POTUS Maybe when businesses see it as favorable to open a business in an area were arson and rampant crime is happening they’ll be more job opportunities for everyone.

84,@BrewRed @HillGriffin @AOC But in 2020 it’s treason?
85,@ksorbs That’s true.
86,@AOC You’re a disgrace to the Bronx.
87,@AyannaPressley @POTUS Sound like you’re saying black people are less responsible at paying off loans. That’s racist!

91,@RepLizCheney The whole thing is going to backfire. People see what you are doing.
92,@Hoohoops @Mattie515 @KeithOlbermann @January6thCmte Many other states tried to take those  states to court because they followed state laws while others didn’t. Not following laws compromises the entire election. The Supreme Court ducked the case saying the states had no standing. How is that possible? No court ever tried facts.
93,@Hoohoops @Mattie515 @KeithOlbermann @January6thCmte The state legislatures make election laws for their state. In each battleground state the laws were not followed but changed by the Secretary of states due to the “covid emergency”. On its face the election was not legal. Mass mail in balloting at the last second changed it all.
94,"@Mattie515 @Hoohoops @KeithOlbermann @January6thCmte This whole “worshipping like a god” thing the left has is so bizarre. No one thinks that, they just know he’s not the one undermining America."
95,@Mattie515 @Hoohoops @KeithOlbermann @January6thCmte Typical leftist non answer.
96,@Mattie515 @Hoohoops @KeithOlbermann @January6thCmte The traitor is the one who purposely dismantled the American economy by pushing gas to $6 a gallon. 2020 was a rigged election. Who would vote for Biden’s policies? Can there be that many low IQ people out there.
