2,If a law or policy is important enough to be instituted then it is important enough to enforce.  Addressing these parking violations is one small step to curbing the crime and homelessness taking over the downtown area.  https://t.co/NGXlVfzf8s

10,"A review ranked WA the 3rd worst state for available VA health care facilities. Despite that, the VA is looking to end services in Spokane. Accessing the care they‚Äôve earned shouldn‚Äôt be a burden on our veteran population. This is completely unacceptable!https://t.co/rOwhwh4Chv"

27,Seattleites continue to pay a high price for the Democrat‚Äôs anti-police policies. It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable that these assaults are not being investigated. Cities that defund their police force should be legally liable for personal and property damages!https://t.co/yUbponOlyf

29,"WA has a public safety crisis. Seattle PD lost 100s of officers over the past 2 years while violent crime during that period escalated.

32,"WA is 1 of 10 states to have a 90% out-of-stock rate for baby formula. As chair of the Health Committee, Senator Murray could have averted this crisis had she taken any action during the 15 MONTHS that she was aware of problems at the Abbott plant. https://t.co/yQV3lTsvgb"
33,Patty Murray is panicking because she knows she failed WA families. One issue she refuses to address- the skyrocketing energy costs. The avg cost of a gal of gas in WA State is $5.54 but Sen. Murray opposes an all-of-the-above energy strategy to return us to energy independence.
34,Democrats should be worried!  More and more Washingtonians are waking up to the fact that Patty Murray‚Äôs policies are hurting our state and they are ready for there to be a new mom in town! https://t.co/xupgEUKz7K
35,"Despite gas nearing $6 per gallon, Joe Biden and Patty Murray still choose to rely on foreign dictators rather than American-made energy.  Main Street voters know how DC policies impact their budgets, and they will vote for new leadership in November to turn this ship around! https://t.co/PN2ydvMKbn"
36,"It‚Äôs time to turn a page, Washington.  We are working with others across the state to get good leaders elected so we can start turning our state around.  Go to https://t.co/IM1hQNSJj1 to be part of the effort! https://t.co/s5aEiQFfOE"
37,How out of touch can Patty Murray get?  At a time when Washingtonians are paying record high energy costs she puts out a plan that would raise energy prices and hurt the economy.  She wants to turn out the lights in Washington! https://t.co/yx4C68uhqv
38,Thank you so much for your support! I will always fight for our nations heroes üá∫üá∏ #TeamSmiley https://t.co/gU4eHwvKHg

40,Every day the information on Patty Murray‚Äôs lack of action on the baby formula crisis just gets worse.  3 months of inaction turns out to actually be 15 months.  The ‚ÄúMom in Tennis Shoes‚Äù has clearly forgotten the moms she is supposed to represent! https://t.co/5sW3m33bs4

53,"Washington‚Äôs out-of-stock baby formula rate now exceeds 90%. Senator Murray chairs the Senate Health Committee and is supposed to be an advocate for women. She did nothing when WA moms needed her most, and they will remember her silence in Nov.‚Äù

56,Formula manufacturers knew months ago this problem could turn into a crisis. Why did it take Patty Murray and Joe Biden nearly 4 months to take the formula supply shortage seriously? This was an abdication of her duties as a senator and HELP chair. https://t.co/Sco3QMXPTH
57,No amount of TV ads can change Patty Murray‚Äôs 35 yr record of raising middle class taxes. She‚Äôs never met a tax hike she didn‚Äôt like! Property tax hikes. Increased taxes on Social Security benefits. Her ads would be laughable if her votes didn‚Äôt hurt WA families and businesses.
58,"I don‚Äôt know what Patty Murray was doing, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt her job! She has the biggest healthcare megaphone in America. Had she simply asked about the impact of the Abbott plant‚Äôs shutdown, we all would have known.https://t.co/X1QXItaFAQ"
59,"Patty Murray‚Äôs favorite solution is to throw money at the problem without addressing the root of the fentanyl crisis - our porous southern border. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòmanufactured crisis‚Äô and she‚Äôs not up to the challenge. It‚Äôs time to retire her!

78,This isn‚Äôt an accomplishment. It‚Äôs a spectacular display of how far the US has fallen. The solution is here in America. As HELP chair Patty Murray should focus on fixing the FDA!

80,"Patty Murray says she is for women, but when it came to making sure WA moms had enough food for their babies she was nowhere to be seen. Seniority means nothing if you don‚Äôt exert your influence, and a megaphone is worthless unless you use it. https://t.co/YAVtR6Q0AU"
81,On Armed Forces Day we recognize the sacrifices made by our military forces and their families every single day.  Scotty and I know how deep those sacrifices can be.  Thank you for your service! https://t.co/nM7oqHUsM5
82,"Stories like this are heartbreaking and happening nationwide. As HELP Chair, Patty Murray had a duty to US families to ensure something like this NEVER happened.

85,"Senator - you sent one letter in Feb, then nothing. Don't tell WA moms you care about this when you've spent more time talking about Daylight Savings than fighting for them!

86,"The Biden Admin is talking out of 2 sides of its mouth. 1 side says they are trying to increase production, the other side cancels off-shore leases. Energy policy = energy investment, bad policies kill it. We can‚Äôt afford Biden/Murray‚Äôs failed policies!
