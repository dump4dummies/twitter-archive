Yeah, that was just about when the pandemic hit.  Yeah, good luck with selling that."
2,@jenniferhorsey @JoNathanVol77 @IngrahamAngle Maybe because those leases don't have any oil?
3,@grumpyonekenobi @Justask95406683 @IngrahamAngle But it worked so well before...didn't it? Lol
4,@surfingwahoo @pearsoncrz @MayraFlores2022 I never said religion should be in politics.  Can you show me where I have ever condoned that?  Or should I break out the crayons for you?  Wait... I know..  it's nappy time

6,@clark_director @LaDeeDaKY @MayraFlores2022 Huh?
7,"@pearsoncrz @MayraFlores2022 In his first year as president, Washington said, “It is the duty of all nations, to acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor.”"
8,"@laurenlaurent11 @ma16354264 @Susan_Dupres @thebradfordfile Nope, I use it all the time.  No problem using it as long as it's correct.  The problem is this.  If you actually knew the difference you would have corrected it.  You didn't."
9,"@laurenlaurent11 @ma16354264 @Susan_Dupres @thebradfordfile I am not insisting, I am just not lazy"
10,"@laurenlaurent11 @ma16354264 @Susan_Dupres @thebradfordfile And again you still can't bring yourself to correct your spelling even though the photo you are referencing can spell it right.  Typical. 
And why would police need to be at every door when simply blocking the entrances would suffice."
11,@laurenlaurent11 @ma16354264 @Susan_Dupres @thebradfordfile And your response has nothing to do with what I said.  Deflect much?
12,"@ryan87845367 @RobSchneider Yes, the Army can have them because The Few, The Proud, sure don't want them."
13,"@laurenlaurent11 @ma16354264 @Susan_Dupres @thebradfordfile So you are saying there are 850 exterior facing doors in the US Capitol building?  (FYI Capital refers to a city, not a building, Capitol is a building)"
14,"@GrenMeera @ShhhhDontTalk @DocEgonSpengler @tedcruz Yes, store my weapon in my house to protect my loved ones when I am home, and carry said weapon when I am with my family outside of my home."
15,"@Paraclete1001 @silent_d_SD @MZHemingway As a Marine, we were told that green is the only color we recognize. And for those Non-military, green is the color of our uniform, not the color of our pay."

20,@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Where is this link that you are referring to?  Just read this whole train of conversation and there isn't a link from you.  Delusional maybe?
21,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax While I am actually reading the bill myself instead of listening to what other people say is in it, let me ask you what You have done to try and make this country a better place other than tweet? I tried to be a Congressman in a poor district"
22,@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax So I guess you can't back up your claim with any verified substance. Just another sheep.
23,@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax It's not presumptious when you make a claim and then be unable to support it with verifiable facts.  Show me one bill that articulates restricting POC ability to vote.
24,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Since I am not the one claiming restrictions are focusing on POC then why should I do the research for you? I prefer to keep my mind open by going to the source.
https://t.co/2glfcoD54e"
25,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax No, I prefer to keep my eyes open by going to the source.  If I only listened or watched FoxNews then I would be as guilty as you.  I would be spouting nonsense without substance. 
BTW it's real simple to look up bills that are introduced.
https://t.co/2glfcoD54e"
26,"@Wildshires71 @bunnykisses7 @BrandonStraka No such thing as a ""perfect anything"" but if I had to pick a time when government was more willing to work with each other (after all, isn't that what everyone is talking about) 80 to 88 was better than 2000 to 2008"
27,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Please don't just say it, give me the bill number.  Anyone can quote TV headlines."
28,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax So POC cannot carry identification, is that what you are saying?  Because identification is the only thing they are asking for that everyone is up in arms about."
29,@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Headed by members of the Democrat party
30,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Please give me any bills in Congress that are written and sponsored by Replublicans that are trying to undermine the Civil Rights Act.
And please show me how many switched parties. 
And if you had read the article that I sent you would have seen that it was stuck in Committee"
31,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Straight from the source (not Wikipedia) on the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If it wasn't for Republicans, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would have never passed. https://t.co/t6aMRRJlEk"
32,"@nojust1 @nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Yes, a Congress controlled by the Republicans.  Thank you for clarifying that."
33,@nonameinmich @ReeceLynn @strategicscope @newsmax Yes and slavery was also upheld by case law decided by the Supreme Court in Dred Scott vs Sanford (1857). Now are you going to tell me that the Supreme Court never makes a mistake?

40,"@jelliottblake @POTUS Oh I completely agree with you @jelliottblake Who ever gets vax should get a mark, like a tattoo on the back of their hand (not forehead, thats too Biblical) so that when they go to the store they just wave their hand over the scan before they checkout....LOL couldn't help myself"
41,"@bullcrap1 @tedcruz Maybe you should look at Mr. George Takei profile.  He calls himself Sulu, King of the Internet"
42,"@digbyanddad @ALJWS @politvidchannel Yes, Marion Barry is a great example of what happens when a Democrat gets in trouble.  Spends a few months in jail and is reelected back to the same job he had before."
43,"@JimBaxa1 @Kathi48 @GregAbbott_TX @MichaelDell Its amazing that people have abdicated all self responsibility and expect the government to do what we should be doing.  Like JFK said.... Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country...."
