28,"@Hey_MissKeisha Past and current Presidents of both organizations can speak to my dedication and work ethic. When I moved here I wanted to support the youth. From 2012-2019, I’ve been in school full-time, working, and volunteering where possible. I will seek endorsements once on the ballot."
29,"@Hey_MissKeisha If I were a D or R, I would only need to pay 100 and submit paperwork. There is no vetting of the two major parties’ candidates to get on the ballot. Anyone can put their hat in. I originally had to collect 5,067 signatures. Which is fine, but it is a different standard."
30,"@Shavonne191920 @Hey_MissKeisha Running during Covid has been very different to say the least. I appreciate you taking the time to read the text. We were suppose to be out in Druid Hill, but the storm hit. We try to make sure we tell folks to hit STOP in case the text are too much. I get it."
31,"@Hey_MissKeisha As it relates to Congress, I agree you need to be able to be proximate with the community, but you also have to be able to work with the different branches of government. I’ve worked with state agency heads in MD and county offices for agencies. I’ve also worked in other states."
32,"@Hey_MissKeisha I have been in the National Urban League since 2010. When I moved to Baltimore City, I joined the GBUL and started volunteering in the Saturday Leadership Program. I’ve done that since 2012, even when I moved closer to DC. I also volunteered for the Speak Life Tour organization."
33,@Hey_MissKeisha I graduated law school in May 2019 and started looking for a house in July/August. The date is wrong and I’ve asked them to change it. I closed 10/25/2019 and have the docs to confirm. As you know the seat just came open a few days before. If I ever ran it would have been at 40+.
34,"@Hey_MissKeisha I moved to Baltimore City in 2012 to get my MPA. When I graduated I was looking for a home and then the administration I was in lost the election. I signed up to get my JD, got accepted, and moved closer to DC in 2015. I still continued to volunteer and go to church here."

36,@Hey_MissKeisha @KimberlyWriter No hidden agenda. I truly am an Independent with no ties. I am just tired of the machine not working together to get things done. I worked in government performance and came to gov with the sole purpose to make it better.
37,@KimberlyWriter @Hey_MissKeisha I completely understand. With COVID we had to get creative. Using technology has been a huge part of the strategy. With cases rising I hate asking people to sign my petition in person. I wish that third-parties could just pay the fee and file the necessary paperwork like others.
38,@Hey_MissKeisha I do not want to be governor. I stepped up to run for Congress because 1: the fighting in Washington has to stop. Over the last decade Congress has passed fewer laws than in decades. I have worked with Ds and Rs in state and local and want to bridge us back together.
39,"@Hey_MissKeisha I thought the same thing as it related to commercials, but they are actually very reasonable. I planned to launch earlier but COVID hit. We also realized that people were confused due to so many elections in a short period. So we slowed down communication until after primaries."
40,"@CarolSOtt @Hey_MissKeisha Thank you for tagging me because I didn’t see any of the questions. I see them now and will address on the thread. I actually left my job in February prepare to run, but Covid hit in March. I first moved to Bmore in 2012. But have been visiting for years due to family."
