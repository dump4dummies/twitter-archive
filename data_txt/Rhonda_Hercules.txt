64,"@RavenJadewolfe So you just give up? You can't even stand up for yourself, and you're going to fault me for trying to fight for all of us. Yep, the politicians have you right where they want you. While they use you, you think they want to take care of you. Wake up."
65,"@RavenJadewolfe The republican party didn't give me a dime. How many times must I tell you...there are NO parties. Yet  you try to convince me you're not programmed. They never gave me a talking point, and I haven't said anything you've claimed. nonsensical."
66,@RavenJadewolfe The abortion theatrics is a distraction. And you say you're not played by the media. Abortion isn't going anywhere. It's all about dividing people. Not being able to get that thru your head is the problem. Instead of thinking I hate you because I ran republican...
67,"@RavenJadewolfe Really? How so? To whom? See, it's always the ones screaming the loudest about inclusivity that are the most closed minded, assumptive, hypocrites. How dare anyone label you, yet you'll make false assumptions all over me. You are dead wrong."
68,"@RavenJadewolfe How do you not matter? You have the same vote as I. You work and pay taxes, just as I. That's all we matter to them. And if I saw you on the street how would I know all these things about you? I wouldn't."
69,@RavenJadewolfe Really? How so?
70,"@RavenJadewolfe Like I said, you are sorely mistaken if you're going to label people based on a party affiliation. How else was I going to run? The me, myself and I party? I wouldn't mistake the dems for my friend, if I were you. They are all one in the same."
71,"@RavenJadewolfe I don't label people. You are the one who is labeling me. We are all just people. I treat everyone at face value. Until you give me a reason, I have nothing against anyone."
72,@RavenJadewolfe What do you think I'm doing? Just because I registered republican doesn't mean I subscribe to every bullet point the media feeds you. I am educated. Do you think I don't know any different people? Or even have different people in MY family. I do.
73,@RavenJadewolfe Why would you even think that?! You're wrong. What in the world that I ever said would make you think that??
74,"@RavenJadewolfe There are no republicans and democrats. They're one in the same, against all of us. White men included. The 2 party system is another pack of lies. More lip service to keep us divided. At every turn they divide because they wouldn't want us to get our $hit together."
75,"@RavenJadewolfe @BuchserSusan @Cliffcrafter81 @RepAlexMooney @RepMcKinley I actually think that it might benefit education to leave it to the states, and take the federal govt out of that equasion. Just a thought .... always more to learn."
76,"@RavenJadewolfe I can't understand how we could fault anyone for loving. I don't care who you love, it's your right to do so. Others don't have to like it. An opinion is not needed...just move along and go in peace. I am sorry you have to deal with that."
77,"@RavenJadewolfe I have always been the first to stand up and threaten the bully right back. I have never put up with that BS, and never will. There is something mentally wrong with those who feel good about making others feel bad. I don't want anyone to feel like that."
78,"@RavenJadewolfe Politicians don't care about us, and never will. They only care during campaign season. Then they promise the same BS every time...and we fall for it! LOL"
79,"@RavenJadewolfe I've already lost, and I'm still listening. And I really honestly do care. It's passionate people like you and me that need to step up, do something now before it's too late. All this political theater is meant to divide us, and I won't fall for that."
80,"@RavenJadewolfe We have gun laws. We need to enforce them. I know you'll probably disagree with me here, but I think that much of the gun violence has been incited in order to make people reactive. False flags are a reality. They play us like a fiddle."
81,"@RavenJadewolfe I work for a living too. Completely agree with you. This has been a multifaceted take down of America, and taking away our manufacturing left us economically disadvantaged and demoralized. Meaningful employment would fix many of our problems."
82,"@RavenJadewolfe Yes, higher education and healthcare should be much more affordable. Much!"
83,@RavenJadewolfe We are in agreement on all the things you've said you'd like to see. I am also sick of the political and social climate we're in. And I believe that most of the hatred and division is  by design to take us down. We can't beat them if we're fighting with each other.
84,"@RavenJadewolfe I agree. It's what I call lip service. They'll tell you that's their purpose, but don't really mean it. They think they're above us. They aren't."
85,@RavenJadewolfe @BuchserSusan @Cliffcrafter81 @RepAlexMooney @RepMcKinley I think it's important to teach both. We have to be realistic. We have to instill self-respect in our kids. There's nothing wrong with waiting.

96,@RavenJadewolfe @BuchserSusan @Cliffcrafter81 @RepAlexMooney @RepMcKinley Really? Which Republicans? I haven't heard anyone say anything like that. The controversy isn't over medical facts about bodies. More like age appropriateness and content.
