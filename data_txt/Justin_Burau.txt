11,@STLCards327 @sfinchie @Delia4Congress You can own an air missle? Where you getting it from?
12,@sfinchie @Delia4Congress Because an AR15 is a brand not a weapon. Find me one military person that would go into battle with what you are talking about.
13,@Delia4Congress @Delia4Congress you never talk about your policies. Please name 1 policy you have introduced to make Illinois a safer place against guns? We have the most strict guns laws so we should be safest right? Sounds like a talking point for you and not an issue.
