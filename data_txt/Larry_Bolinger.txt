26,I would push and support a couple of our biggest assets to help relations between our country and others. Two of our biggest assets is the farming industry and the medical industry. Two areas of interest is South America and Africa.
27,I would help with creating grants to help address the growing homeless problem in our nation. The states need to increase their total room allowable for HUD housing and VA housing.
28,I would tackle the many of the policy and procedures surrounding the bank and government processes on foreclosures that are based on enriching banks in unethical manners.
29,"Revamp penalties surrounding victimless crimes. With the over crowding of our corrections facility, the high price of holding prisoners and the legalization of marijuana, there is a need to update penalties for marijuana possession."
30,"Reduce government spending and redirect some of the cashflow. One way that I would push for change is to decrease compounded government entities so we can put more money back into our schools, medicare, medicaid, Human service programs, VA and secure our social security."
31,Clean coal technology: I want to be able to protect the Rail Road and Mining jobs and the other entities that those impact. By pushing more interest in clean coal can help secure those jobs and utilize their filtration system to better water supplies.

38,"My stance on the abortion issue. I did push for support for planned parenthood if they reduced abortions to 12 weeks, but they lost any and all support when they and several states approved of abortions at full term. So this needs a total defunding and reform of health care."

41,A few things I want to push in my campaign is to get rid of inheritance tax. That's both a state and federal issue and should not be a tax issue. You pay on a property for 50 years and get things set up for your kids and don't want that put in jeopardy because of that tax.
