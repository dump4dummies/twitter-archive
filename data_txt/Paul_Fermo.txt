24,"Storming the US Capitol is not “legitimate political discourse.” The attack on Jan 6th was violent &amp; anti-democratic. Rep. Fitzpatrick broke his oath when he put party over county &amp; he did nothing about it. 

PA01 deserves a representative with the character to do what is right. https://t.co/BgULfDgP0D"
25,Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick voted against the Freedom to Vote: John Lewis Act to ensure elections are free and fair. It is time to replace Fitzpatrick with a representative in DC who has integrity and believes in protecting the right to vote for all Americans. 2/2
26,"On this day in 1870, the 15th Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote for every American, was ratified. This right is essential to our democracy. No one, republican, democrat, nor independent, should have their vote suppressed. 1/2"

28,"This week, the US took an enormous step in strengthening the military's response to sexual harassment by making it a crime &amp; requiring complaints to be handled by independent investigators outside of the chain of command. Sexual harassment has no place in our armed forces."
29,"On this #HolocaustRemembranceDay, and everyday, let us never forget the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust.  With antisemitism on the rise around the world, we must recomit to erradicating hate from our communities."
30,"We deserve a representative who has the courage to fight for a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, not buckle under party pressure. 3/3"

34,I am relieved that the hostages at Congregation Beth Israel have been rescued in TX &amp; thankful to law enforcement for ensuring their safe release. My thoughts are with the Jewish community. We cannot allow antisemitism to be normalized. All should be able to worship without fear.
35,"Once again, Brian Fitzpatrick voted AGAINST ensuring elections are free and fair for all Americans - whether you're a Democrat, Republican or unaffiliated. We need a representative in DC with integrity. Not someone who doesn’t believe in protecting the right to vote."

38,"By voting against creating a bipartisan committee to investigate who was behind this attack and whether it went all the way up to the Oval Office itself, Fitzpatrick failed to act. He played it safe and put his political future and his party before the values of our country. 3/4"
39,"Simply saying that the assault on our democracy was wrong is not enough. Talk is cheap. Talk is easy. Talk is safe. True character is revealed at the point when a leader has to make a decision - character is action, not words. 2/4"

50,The right to choose faces its most serious challenge since it was enshrined in Roe v. Wade. Mississippi’s abortion ban threatens the reproductive rights of every woman. This is a personal decision that should be left between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/6YK5E7YojP
