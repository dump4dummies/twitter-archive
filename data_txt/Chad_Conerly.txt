1,"@JReinerMD @CDCgov November 8th is still too far away.  Don’t worry, they’ll raise the panic level on the politically appropriate date."
2,"@nashville_brook @ggreenwald @daveweigel If I’m with you on this, does that include doctors treating gender dysphoria in teens/children?"
3,@KatieCorkern I thought the Chinese Lanterns were a nice touch.
4,"@Funkyp14 @tomwatson If the dems have not moved left, why was an anti gay marriage stance a “political advantage” to win the democrat nomination in 08?  Can you imagine that stance in today’s democrat party?"
5,@Funkyp14 @tomwatson https://t.co/TlzIAGESvD
6,"@tomwatson In 2008, the democratic presidential nominee campaigned on/won as an “anti gay marriage” candidate, so I think we can agree the Democratic Party has moved to the left."
7,"@thorsson_john @elonmusk @ChrisJBakke Agreed!  @elonmusk should have dedicated his life to the betterment of mankind for $33 an hour plus benefits like @3YearLetterman.  We wouldn’t have Tesla or SpaceX, but I envision an impressively tricked out Taurus."
8,@zerohedge @DarrenJBeattie @Twitter You define “value” too narrowly…they provided Hunter B great value ;)
9,@KelbyDaigleLA The New York Post would disagree ;)
10,"@KelbyDaigleLA I’ve seen the vile fights you pick on Twitter.  I’ve made the point that our service members should not be the play things of you or our governing elite. I’ll exit this conversation now, and let you bask in the glory of being the bully on this fake playground."
11,"@KelbyDaigleLA All military services are hiring…if you love war, there’s no better seat in the house than the front line."
12,"@KelbyDaigleLA Sounding like a shareholder of Lockheed Martin.  I’ve had an RPG land within 100 yards of me in Iraq, and many others have experienced much much worse.  At least root for sanctions to work first."
13,@JoeDunman What a waste…you don’t need plastic bags in the trash cans to catch water.  That money could have been put into the football program.
14,"@joerogan @Spotify Joe, You are wrong…we have always been at war with Eastasia"
15,@artificer_the @beetlehound1 @WhackNicholson @chelcielynnn “Not suitable for work” is in your bio.  You can change that ;)
16,"@JSODonoghue Now do local, state, and national politics ;)"

18,"@MurfStream @mymomsgonecraz3 @BoricuaEnBoston @SandraLuna1129 @selfo96 @JamesRosenTV @POTUS @WhiteHouse I will agree with you that 18 year olds are too immature to understand basic contractual obligations that affect only THEIR live, if you agree with me that those same teenagers are too immature to vote in national elections that affect the entire country. Agreed?"
19,@kittypurrzog Denise is a perfect Trans-word in Louisiana.  It can easily be changed to Denephew.  A little Cajun humor.
20,"@ScottAdamsSays I’m 2X jabbed w/breakthrough, not anti vax…just anti mandate.         Issue for most is slippery slope giving inch after inch.  Walmart opens an hour early for only “at risk”.  Many focused mitigation efforts would limits neg Covid outcomes and gain wide antivaxer support."
21,"@bgmasters Would appreciate your take on a concern that I have. Will the effort to destigmatize pedo (MAP “normal” if they don’t act against a child); and the creation of lifelike robots w/ no soul/emotions to harm, eventually allow pedos to purchase lifelike 8 year old “pleasure dolls?”"
22,"@KelbyDaigleLA It was at a Popeyes Buffet that I first learned that 3 breast, 4 drumsticks, 3 biscuits and nothing else, was in fact a proper meal."
23,"@kittypurrzog Ironically, I use he/her often at coffee shops…I ask the barista: could “you” ask “her” (person fetching my danish) to heat it.  They need more gender wheels."
24,"@samkarlin I’ve done several of these over my Air Force finance career.  In the case of a “local” base (State-side or overseas), its primary purpose is to strengthen the bond between the local community and military personnel (highlights the major economic impact the base has on the town)"
25,"@ellencarmichael I tend to agree; however, don’t rule out the Republicans ability to completely blow this momentum between now and next fall."
26,"@FutureDrSmith1 @nhannahjones @EdInDissent I don’t have a political brand. I ran one race, lost overwhelmingly, and returned to my amazing “normal” life.  Can we at least both agree that there should be more everyday Americans running for office, and fewer career politicians?  That should be bipartisan."
27,@FutureDrSmith1 @nhannahjones @EdInDissent I guess I’m finished since you don’t have any answers
28,@orchidvariety @FutureDrSmith1 @nhannahjones @EdInDissent I’m confused. Did LP send “white nationalist” with tiki torches to inflame racial tensions? Or was it Democrats?  Just trying to figure out which of those two groups are allowed to be racist.
29,"@FutureDrSmith1 @nhannahjones @EdInDissent I suspect you do know.  However, assuming you believe them to be a true Republican organization, shouldn’t they face serious backlash for their overtly racist actions that day?"
30,@FutureDrSmith1 @nhannahjones @EdInDissent I’ll bite…please list a few national Republican candidates endorsed by the Lincoln Project since the “Republican group” was formed.
31,@nhannahjones @EdInDissent Not like this! https://t.co/8kvzTGKuwq
32,"@KelbyDaigleLA @AdamKinzinger Try not to let “orange man bad” guide all your political analysis.  Trump won IL-16 by 17 points, and AK knows he’ll lose his re-election bid.  Fine to give him points for voting his conscience instead of toeing the party line, but you can’t pretend to be surprised at the outcome"
33,"@nwlaguy Side note: I lived two years in Guam and visited CNMI.  Absolutely beautiful, just a terribly taxing trip getting there."
34,"@nwlaguy I can assure you the exodus hasn’t resulted in a real estate bust.  I’ve been looking (dreaming) of a vacation home down there for years, but it’s def beyond my reach.  I was counting on that “insider trading” beni if elected to Congress, but now that option is out for me haha."
35,@nwlaguy A political “novice” with high name recognition and 0 record to critique given 100% establishment support before other candidates emerge.  I’m familiar with this phenomenon.  Prevents the preferred candidate from being carefully vetted.  Dangerous game for a purple seat.
36,"@nhannahjones Sadly, democrats don’t have to focus on black votes. Decades of democrat neglect of minority populations and the community still “block votes” for “D” 90+%.  Where is the motivation to change the status quo when it’s working just fine for those in power?"
37,"@nwlaguy I was at a LA GOP fundraiser a few weeks ago.  An RSCC member suggested to the LA GOP Chair that they (GOP) “pick and back” a candidate “early,” so as to avoid an expensive/contested primary. I hope the LA GOP instead will facilitate a robust primary among a talented field."
38,@SirajAHashmi @elizableu I though she blocked you last week?
39,@nwlaguy One of the reasons debates are so important…they can occasionally expose accidental moments of truthfulness.
40,"Hope Twitter-verse will help me w/ research (not my strong suit).  Was the 2021 LA-5 congressional primary the most diverse GOP candidate field in the history of LA-5?  Pretty sure it was, but can’t confirm.  @lagop #LA05 #LAlege #LAgov"
41,@RepKatiePorter You must have a “trust fund” or “golden goose” piggy bank. My piggy bank only allows me to extract the money I put in it.
42,"@AlisonKateCartr @NPR Thousands of baby “girls of color” go missing every year in planned parenthood clinics.  Two go in, and only one comes out.  Perhaps we can solve this mystery."
43,"@nhannahjones Or, “why fund the police when we elites have private security”"
44,@brailemom @JSODonoghue From the CDC: “COVID 19-vaccines are effective. They can keep you from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19” (neither of which was achieved in my case).  If we are to follow the science…data seems worth tracking to me.
45,"@JSODonoghue Agreed!  I’m fully vaccinated (since March), and while not hospitalized, I’m currently Covid positive and very symptomatic.  I’ve also transmitted Covid to my wife.  Cases like mine should absolutely be tracked."
46,"Disagree.  They’re onto something wrt big money/special interest in LA politics.  A very extended campgn would be the only option for an “R” to challenge an R incumbent, because they’d be running against the entire LA GOP machine.  A run against Kennedy would be in vain IMO. https://t.co/yZDs6XQaRw"
47,"@ScottAdamsSays Most people acknowledge a 55 MPH speed limit would “save lives”.  However, the negligible benefit of the few lives saved is substantially outweigh by the numerous negatives affecting everyday life.  Same here IMO."
48,"@redsteeze Cancel the “Ball” established in 1878 with an “unquestionably racist past”; but only if we also cancel those associated with the “Party” established in 1828 with an “unquestionably racist past”.  If an organization’s past cannot be forgiven, all “D’s” gotta go!"

67,"@nwlaguy Not my coming out party...my “Go Big or go home” party.  If elected, I’ll proudly serve the people of the 5th with distinction. If not elected, I’ll go back to farming and my political career will be over.  The “candidate/politician for life” is the problem, not the solution."
