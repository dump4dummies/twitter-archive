6,The will of the American people is the right to choose we have to show @RepChrisStewart the will of the people by voting him out. https://t.co/uyTHJpCOZ2
7,@RepChrisStewart voted against the Bipartisan gun bill that will help save lives. Remember this come November 8th. #utpol #2ndAmendment https://t.co/XwGbvxNixm
8,"Get out and vote.Make sure to elect leaders who will protect those Americans who are marginalized through passing of the Equal Rights Amendment. SCOTUS failed us, but we will fight back and we will earn back our constitutionally guaranteed rights. It’s going to take all of us."
9,"We don’t know how far this conserative #SCOTUS will go to strip the rights of our fellow Americans, so we must protect them."
10,"Third, we must pass and ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which will protect marginlized groups and eliminate any discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or race."
11,"Second, after voting in representatives who will protect our rights, we must codify Roe V Wade so abortion access and reproductive rights will be protected at the national level."
12,"First, we must elect leaders who will protect the rights of all Americans. We must show up on November 8th and vote out anti-choice representatives like @RepChrisStewart"
13,"The implications that this ruling has is far reaching; it shows us nothing is safe. with Clarence Thomas saying they need to reconsider Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell, marriage equality and contraception rights might be next to go. We have a couple steps we must do right now:"
14,"With Roe V Wade gone, apathy is a position we can no longer afford to have. We must fight like hell to protect our rights as American Citizens. We need to elect officials that will fight for these rights. 🧵 #utpol #DobbsvJackson #RoeVsWade"
15,@POTUS is right this is now an issue for the midterm elections. Apathy is no longer a position we can afford to take. Get out and vote! #RoeVsWade #BlueWave #utpol
16,@RepChrisStewart And the people want the right to choose their own reproductive healthcare. They want the right to choose if they want an abortion or not.
17,"The US Supreme Court just overturned Roe V Wade eliminating our constitutional rights to abortion. We should all be outraged. We are in for a fight, and must get people into office that will fight to protect the rights of Americans. This is a very scary precedent."
18,The only widespread fraud was coming from Trump and his conspirators. The bravery of all those testifying is amazing. We owe all those you protected our Republic our deepest gratitude. We need to vote out all the conspirators that includes @RepChrisStewart and @SenMikeLee #utpol
19,"@RepChrisStewart The people are tired of your lies and misinformation. I’m offering a change where I don’t just blame people and lie,I actually come up with solutions to problems and act. I offer a change in leadership that is sorely needed."
20,"There is too much time spent talking about the economy and how to fix it. I know my plans will help working families, small businesses, and the state’s economy.

21,With the January 6th hearings happening I want to remind everyone that @RepChrisStewart voted to Reject the Pennsylvania and Arizona election results. Make no mistake @RepChrisStewart tried to knowingly overthrow Democracy.He needs to be held accountable. #utpol #BlueWave2022
22,I can get behind the newly released commonsense gun legislation. I wish they just raised the age to 21 instead of enhanced background checks but I’m just glad it has broad bipartisan support so it’s likely to pass which is good. Let’s get this gun reform done!
23,"@RepChrisStewart Utah, we deserve so much more from our leadership and that’s what I’m offering. Change; something better. We can vote him out this November, let’s do it."
24,Wow!! What an emotional testimonies from all those who testified today.The amount of pressure and threats that they received for just doing their jobs is outrageous. We must vote out those who helped push the lies Trump was trying to sell. #VoteBlue #VoteThemOut2022 #utpol
25,"@RepChrisStewart How do you explain Europe having a steep rise in inflation as well? The entire world is dealing with inflation because of the war in Ukraine. It’s not the only reason why we have inflation, but it’s a big reason. Correlation doesn’t not mean causation. https://t.co/JAJE6DjbkW https://t.co/YdC6UEEmzE"

All bills which would have funded local projects. Another day, another @RepChrisStewart lie. #utpol https://t.co/qYDd1pksrj"
33,"Once again, @RepChrisStewart has shown that his loyalties lie with his allies in Congress, not the people of Utah’s 2nd Congressional District. As your representative, I will be a voice of integrity and reason, not of lies and deceit. #utpol https://t.co/wN4GCBklHQ"

58,"@jortron It doesn’t come down to just functionality of an assault rifle. What else is important is caliber size, and the ability to mod assault rifle with a DIAS. There is no need to have an a weapon of war in the general public."
59,@jortron Well banning the “cosmetics” of the Assault rifle won’t really do anything if the base functionality is the same. It does nothing.
60,@jortron What exactly are you asking? I’m not clear on your question.
61,This is a real questions to those who own assault rifles: How would your daily life schedule change if you no longer had your assault rifle? #utpol #2ndAmendment

64,"Did you know in 1959 ArmaLite,the original developer of the AR-15, sold its design to Colt due to poor sales. Later, Colt won the Bid to make the AR-15 AKA the M-16 for our military. Assault Rifles were made for warfare not personal use. We need commonsense gun laws."
65,@RepChrisStewart @POTUS Complete silence on the mass shooting that took place where 18 children were murdered. That’s not the type of leadership we need right now. What are you going to do about gun reform?!
66,Steve Kerr gets it! Something needs to be done! Commonsense gun laws are a must. We have to act! Enough is enough. We need people in office who will act for the good of the people. https://t.co/zxnPGfx3Pe
