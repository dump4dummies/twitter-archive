18,@DougCongress Great meeting all around!
19,"This extremism does not represent the majority of Eastern Washington, including Republicans. Cathy McMoRo sits silent while these extremists are trying to claim our region. The Republican needs new leadership and refocus their values! https://t.co/lacJvAK3rM"

21,"Was waiting for the connection back to our district - if you‚Äôre a Republican, you need to check your party and the far right extremism Cathy has embraced. She continues to defend the Big Lie that‚Äôs been proven false and has invigorated hate groups across our region. Disgusting. https://t.co/ik8donVf2m"
22,This is the kind of domestic terrorism Cathy McMoRo and her colleagues who tried to overthrow our government have inspired. Vote them out! https://t.co/Lym8lwYHPC
23,Far right racist groups in our district and Idaho do not represent our region! We will not tolerate their violence and expect laws to be enforced to the fullest extent. I grew up taking trips to Coeur d‚ÄôAlene and the efforts to end the Aryan marches. We must keep up the fight! https://t.co/O7o5k8bvBv

25,"@Primemeow They also make it harder to detect and allow for more destruction. We have laws on the books already and rolling it back is the wrong direction for our country, especially when we have an opportunity to pass more responsible gun laws."
26,"Let‚Äôs talk about Republicans like Cathy McMoRo co-sponsoring the Hearing Protection Act, H.R.95 that would repeal the requirement to register silencers. So while they pray, they are making it easier to commit mass murderers! Vote them out! https://t.co/zP8nTBOS51"

28,@Jaylee2076 with what‚Äôs at stake this mid-term we must turn out the vote and save ourselves! Cathy‚Äôs vowed she will never ban ‚Äúweapons of war‚Äù including increasing age to 21 and universal background checks. She is a powerless party puppet at this point. https://t.co/DVQ4sRODCq

31,"I spoke with a voter recently about being pro 2nd Amendment and supporting responsible gun laws. Yes, if you serve in military at 18, weapons of war are appropriate. If you are not, banning them is also appropriate. If we want better laws-CMR has to go! https://t.co/4bHPxolRio"
32,Assault weapons didn‚Äôt event exist when the constitution was written - and no right is absolute. Laws that will make it harder to obtain these weapons are needed NOW! No parent should have to identify their child by DNA because an 18 year old can buy weapon made for war. https://t.co/hbynxnktL0

39,@ElectGallardo Thank you - and likewise! This is why they need us! Let‚Äôs go!
40,This is how to do it! I support all unionizing efforts. Collective bargaining gives the power back labor to protect workers. I also support efforts to create greater equity within Unions as well so women and people of color benefit proportionally as well. Let‚Äôs go! https://t.co/NHSp5sQszK
41,@SafetyBob4 Police culture has to change so police aren‚Äôt covering up misconduct and are holding each other accountable. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take to stop the gang culture mentality that‚Äôs unfortunately persisted. It‚Äôs a problem they need to fix so opinions can change.
42,@Mark_Wylie001 This one was said at a Town Hall and I find highly problematic she is using my community advocacy as a talking point instead of her own platform for support.
43,"@Mark_Wylie001 Interesting you see this as me making it harder, and not her, for saying this in her Town Halls. Her projections are simply made up. She informed me directly that I could beat her in primary, but she could beat Cathy in general - that logic is simply not statistically supported."
44,@SafetyBob4 Where‚Äôs the hope in that!?! And not at all upset with cynicism because I do understand. I believe it is possible -uphill battles can be won! Things have changed in the last 2 years and we will continue to organize for changes that simply can‚Äôt wait for Cathy to retire on her own.
45,@SafetyBob4 Oh I‚Äôm aware of past races and attacks - Lisa Brown is an advisor on our campaign. We need progressive Dems that aren‚Äôt afraid to take on Cathy‚Äôs machine and stand for what‚Äôs right. Here I am. Appreciate your perspective because we have to be ready!
46,@SueWhitcomb We agree - gun access is the problem an need federal law to ensure safer communities.
47,"@SafetyBob4 I‚Äôm not afraid to call it like it is. While law enforcement serves a community purpose to respond to and investigate crime, it doesn‚Äôt stop crime no matter how well funded. Police cover up culture is well documented and studied and that‚Äôs what has to change."
48,"When elected I will push to ban assault rifles, mandate background checks and waiting periods, and enhance red flag laws. Guns aren‚Äôt the problem - it‚Äôs U.S. laws!                School Shootings by Country 2022 https://t.co/IR8NGLjzJR"

Eastern Washington deserves a Democratic Representative who will stand for ALL people, even if it‚Äôs not popular with Republicans. We can‚Äôt afford more double agents like Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema in office. We need real change and we need it now!"
52,"and accepting these invitations to speak. I have been an attorney for 15 years, usually representing the underdog against Fortune 500 companies and know how to win. Don‚Äôt believe the competitions hype - she is reaching for a reason. We are kicking ass with endorsements"
53,"So, word on the street is that my Dem opponent in primary doesn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm a strong candidate because I spoke out at our Black Lives Matter protests‚Ä¶ while also claiming she will lift up minority communities. Is she for real?

55,"I‚Äôll say it again - more police is not the answer! ‚Äúat least eight calls from the classrooms to 911 between 12:03 p.m., a half hour after Ramos first entered the building, and 12:50 p.m., when Border Patrol agents and police burst in and shot Ramos dead.‚Äù  https://t.co/NogjpQUbqf"
56,@Elainabush9 Agreed! We can and must improve all systems!
57,@PearlyB57 @TeamCMR Thank you for your support! Together is how we win this!
58,More police and more guns are not the answer. It‚Äôs time to accept facts and data. No constitutional right is absolute and unfettered. Responsible gun laws save lives and every other country proves it. #followthefacts #flipthefifth https://t.co/2DzJspYrz1

62,"This is the right response! While Cathy McMorris Rodgers voted against HR 8, a bipartisan bill for universal background checks 90% of Americans want, we have 50 Senators that need to step up to do their jobs - you work us, not lobbyists - do your damn job! https://t.co/7yu9dVKsBS"
63,@concernecus And we need to bring it like lives depend on it - they do!
64,We can have both gun rights and responsible gun laws to keep our communities safe. Politicians like Cathy won‚Äôt do anything to address our gun access issue - she is too busy taking hundreds of thousands from gun lobbyists and the NRA. We need new representation NOW! https://t.co/mZB5CpC4FG

69,"Hey Cathy- Your vote against legislation to address the baby formula crisis is SHAMEFUL. Demanding things be your party‚Äôs way, or no way is short sighted. You are more focused on blaming Biden for things he didn‚Äôt cause than finding immediate solutions. https://t.co/CGeteZUdzT"
