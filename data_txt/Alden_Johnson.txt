0,It’s not that 3rd Party candidates aren’t taken seriously; The establishment Parties are terrified that we would win and use money to sue candidates off of ballots and use money to influence media coverage in their favor.
1,@TrekkieMetalFan @LarrySharpe @ChaseForLiberty I understand your decision regarding the LP. I appreciate your decision to continue supporting principled candidates.
2,@Delta @steflnyc Then Delta should make it right. I’m spending the night standing in line in Atlanta with hundreds of other Delta customers who are victims. Please make it right. Actions speak louder than words.
3,States don’t have rights. Individuals do. #retweet
4,Please read. Alden is the principled choice for South Mississippi. #Dobbs https://t.co/kKYSUDXQ83
5,@cookinms Thank you.
6,I’m not watching the Palazzo/Ezell debate. My reasoning is that it doesn’t matter which one of my opponents win the primary. My platform remains the same &amp; speaks for itself. #lookaheadMS
7,RT @jallen1985: This Steven Palazzo/Mike Ezell debate is making me more and more interested in @Alden4Congress.
8,The SCOTUS decision regarding Roe won’t reduce abortions. Replacing abstinence only education with real preventative info and allowing OTC hormonal birth control reduce abortion. #RoeVsWade
9,I’ll file a bill to end proxy voting in Congress. Representatives are charged with representing. Delegation or absentee lawmaking is not acceptable except for extenuating circumstances. #representation
10,Nothing says “smaller government” like poorly thought out legislation. This isn’t what liberty looks like folks. https://t.co/axCerud9WW
11,What’s up? @StevenPalazzo I just saw your latest campaign ad. Nervous?
12,"Question everything, especially authority."
13,"My idea of freedom isn’t banning books, stigmatizing cannabis, and wanting to cancel the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Vote for the true liberty candidate. Vote for Alden #Freedom"
14,"3 options for MS in November. An anti-cannabis Republican, A democrat who says that he doesn’t know anything about cannabis but will look into it, and Alden Johnson- Cannabis advocate."
15,"Roe V. Wade was decided using the 14th Amendment. Abortion is an emotional topic for those on both sides of the aisle. However, overturning Roe could place the other cases “settled” using the 14th Amendment at risk. #Marriage #loving"
16,“Swatting” happens regularly. This is when someone reports a fake situation to get the SWAT team to forcibly enter homes as a prank. I support legislation to increase due process in an effort to reduce these “pranks.” #fourthamendment
17,@AJinTheRiver @DaddyLiberty_ @JacobBogle @LPNational MC will run the LP into the ground. We’ll be there to pick up the pieces.
18,@StefanMassong I appreciated the military spending audit. I had high hopes for Trump prior to the 2016 election. I became completely disillusioned around 2018.
19,I pledge allegiance to….. liberty &amp; justice for all. #SCOTUS #American
20,"I was pro Trump until he said ”take the guns first, due process second,” I found out that he was pro tariffs, and that he wanted to seize private property for a wall. Like a lot of Americans, I’m not a Republican or Democrat. #Democrats #republicans"
21,"Ronald Reagan hated firearms, just ask the Black Panthers in California. Most gun restrictions are rooted in racism. Armed minorities are harder to oppress. #Racism"
22,We’re going to fight to get cannabis removed from the controlled substance list. I look forward to that quarterly District 4 town hall after that happens. #smokewithyourcongressman
23,"It’s too easy to mud sling opponents. Voters want to hear what the nominee can and wants to do, not what’s wrong with the other candidates. I let my record speak for itself. #Mississippi"
24,I’ve received an outpouring of support since the primaries. One thing is clear; the residents of District 4 want meaningful change.
25,I support increased precautions in schools. I also highly encourage members of the LGBT community to become proficient in firearm use. I never want another Pulse nightclub massacre. #LGBTQ
26,Their*
27,My point is that I won’t be providing pandering testimonies on CSPAN. My quarterly town halls will serve as an opportunity for constituents to ask questions and to voice concerns. #Integrity
28,"I haven’t and will not ever ask for a photo of myself to be taken while involved with charity work, for two reasons. 1. I don’t want a public photo of someone down on there luck for a brief moment to define them forever. 2. It’s not about me."
29,"I’m old enough to remember the 1990’s “Teletubbies are turning our kids gay” rhetoric. I vaguely remember some parents being really upset, and me not understanding why. Same Pearl clutching, different decade."
30,@ThomasQuiter 100%
31,@IDJoe4Congress The Satanic Temple provides more community service than most churches. I support their mission of volunteerism &amp; preserving the Establishment Clause via strategic P.R. On another note.. we do live in interesting times.
32,"@WrightUps @RepLizCheney Remember when we had a woman on all 50 ballots as a Presidential candidate during the 100th year anniversary of women being able to vote, but the powers that be were too scared to let her debate? I remember."
33,"I welcome a formal debate with my opponents. Preferably one in which the audience asks plenty of questions. Johnny Dupree, @MikeEzellMS @StevenPalazzo @PineBeltNEWS @sunherald #RETWEEET"
34,Imagine tax dollars being used to lock an individual up against their will because they were caught with a plant or fungi. It sounds silly when you say it out loud. #prison4aplant
35,"If you surround yourself by those who are “different” than you, you may just find out that you have more in common than you think. #mselex"
36,"Placing restrictions and/or banning something only creates a lucrative underground market. Be it abortion, firearms, alcohol, or narcotics. Teaching children not to be bullies could drastically reduce shootings. #Violence"
37,@Lukapaka If they’re
38,@Lukapaka No benefit but no disadvantages. It the hopes happy with their current payments keep them. There would be a cash out option in addition with a rollover option. I haven’t worked out all the kinks. I do feel that it would be extremely beneficial in the long term.
39,Transitioning Social Security to a market based program like a Roth IRA is something that I’ve looked at extensively. This small action would bring many elderly out of poverty conditions in a fiscally responsible manner. #SocialSecurity #mselex
40,"@Chad_Edwardz @NeilDancer No, thank you."
41,“Anyone who risks their life to enter this country with only the clothes on their back is no enemy of mine.”-Alden Johnson MS-4 #quote
42,@NeilDancer @Chad_Edwardz Once it’s dropped from the federal controlled substance list I feel that even hesitant states will get on board almost immediately. Let’s make it happen.
43,"Mississippi has a third choice on the ballot this November. “It’s time to normalize this plant, and free the people who are locked up because they chose to possess it.” -Alden Johnson, Libertarian 4th District. #mspol https://t.co/vNL9bBU7my"
44,@jallen1985 I’d love to participate in a debate with only questions asked by the audience.
45,I’ve felt the fear of living without health insurance. “Direct Primary Care” is an excellent low cost healthcare model that benefits both the patient and provider. It’s the future and I’m all for it. #healthcare
46,@katimcf @ashtonpittman Mr. Harrington is a good person with excellent policies. He’ll be on the general election ballot for governor of AR.
47,"RT @ashtonpittman: Living in a stagnant political environment like Mississippi, I've grown convinced that we in the media owe it to voters…"
48,"@whenhen @WFKARS @DNMaher @ashtonpittman I support both. Even well intentioned restrictions can sometimes cause more harm than good, as evidenced by the current situation. Karo’s syrup is flying off of the shelves due to homemade formula recipes."
49,I’m running for Congress because I felt disenfranchised by the system that we have now. I’m running because the federal government shouldn’t be able to tell you what you can put in your body or what you can take out of your body. #mspol #Mississippi
50,"@DNMaher @WFKARS @ashtonpittman Canada also has a lower infant mortality rate (per 100,000) than we do. Surely they’re doing something right."
51,Removing cannabis from the controlled substance list is my first priority. Good people are being locked up daily and cannabis restrictions are holding back employment opportunities. #mspol #mselex
52,Of*
53,It’s been a frustrating uphill battle with receiving fair media coverage. I appreciate @ashtonpittman for being fair with all@of the candidates.
54,What’s my Libertarian solution to the baby formula shortage? Drop the FDA restrictions on imported formula. Let Americans buy it out of country and have it shipped to their house. #formulashortage
55,Two things that set Alden apart from the Republican &amp; Democratic candidates. 1. Alden serves his community as a career firefighter. 2. Alden is the only candidate who fully supports cannabis legalization.
56,RT @ashtonpittman: Libertarian Party candidate Alden Johnson is the only remaining candidate in Mississippi's 4th Congressional District wh…
57,"@WalkrXY It’ll pay for itself within two years on average in mid sized cities. If the officer becomes a liability then they will raise the rates and ultimately terminate coverage. Much like Brookside AL, a lot of cities are one bad apple away from bankruptcy."
58,Q: Should the government…? A: No. They’ve caused enough harm. #US
59,"Pay attention to the candidates not willing to debate, and to the ones currently being investigated. #Vote"
60,@ComicDaveSmith *checks notes as I enthusiastically attend the Rocky Horror Picture Show annually.
61,End qualified immunity. Replace with personal liability insurance. Punishing the tax payers doesn’t make sense.
62,https://t.co/pw1wKMBddq
63,"There are plenty of idiots that own firearms. However, the facts remain the same. Prohibitions don’t work, no matter how well intentioned. I encourage minority groups including the LGBTQ community to buy a firearm and learn how to use it. #LGBT"
64,Remember The Stonewall Uprising. #stonewall
65,"@ESzubski @LPTN1776 I don’t agree with the government seizing private property via eminent domain. Plus, planes and boats also exist."
66,Narcan &amp; fentanyl test strips will save more lives than the “war on drugs” ever will. #WarOnDrugs https://t.co/kvTaklvWrD
67,@802libertarian @raquellrussell I’ve had to answer that question previously. It was asked by a non LP member during my campaign. I explained that there is a far-right faction whose goal is to sabotage the LP in favor of getting extremists elected in the GOP. That seemed to suffice.
68,"@FromMalone @raquellrussell Who’s the Mises guy that attended who was wearing a cape? I want every single one of them to know my name, and to know that I won’t let them sabotage the liberty movement."
69,@raquellrussell Maybe I’m just optimistic in the long game. But I can’t blame those who feel that way and 100% understand why individuals would feel that way.
70,@raquellrussell I give it 6 months. This has unnecessarily set the LP back financially and with P.R. But I don’t believe that it’s dead. They’ve outed themselves as authoritarians.
71,"@raquellrussell I’m staying. I’m still on the ballot, and I’m not going to let a groupthink caucus destroy the Party. They’ll fizzle out on their own. The dog finally caught the car and they don’t know what to do next."
72,I condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant.
73,"@GileadsWorld @YoungEx20 @LPMississippi You’re entitled to your opinion, however wrong it may be."
74,RT @LPMississippi: We support the rights of LGBTQ people to be free from state interference on their personal relationships and identities.…

76,My offer still stands to the other candidates of District 4. A true audience Q &amp; A with allowed rebuttals. All questions will be asked by the audience. Any organization want to head this up? #realpeoplewantrealanswers
77,"I appreciate the NAACP of Forrest County, The League of Women Voters Pine Belt, and Mississippi M.O.V.E for hosting the candidate forum yesterday evening. #Vote"
78,"@JoAnnLChateau My campaign is grassroots. I have financed the majority of the campaign myself. My FEC assets disclosure, and contribution reports are current."
79,"The government is making interest on your tax dollars that have already been used to pay for student loans. Most borrowers have already paid their original debt back X 2-3. It’s the government that we should be pissed at, not each other. #StudentLoanJustice"
80,"Tyrants are begging for more government control over bodily autonomy, inflation has spiraled out of control, Israel has created an International incident, and books are still being banned. #smallgovernment"
81,Congress needs to immediately call for an independent investigation regarding the death of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. This should be a bipartisan effort. #JournalismIsNotACrime
82,"Come out to ask me the tough questions, and watch as I answer the important  questions at the Long Beach candidate forum on Saturday.#tyrantsshallbeyeeted"
83,"I left the Republican Party not because I don’t like other Republican voters, but because Republican politicians are hell bent on turning us into a theocracy. #GOP #women"
84,@ourselves_own Agreed
85,Completely abolishing the government seems less radical with each passing day. #legalizefreedom
86,"Every adult should have the right to love who they want, protect themselves how they see fit, and should be entitled to a level of privacy that includes what you put into your body, and what you take out of it. #HandMaidsTale2022"
87,The U.S. Senate rushed immediate bipartisan legislation to provide armed security for SCOTUS at their homes. But they haven’t had 10 minutes to sign off on cannabis legalization? #SCOTUS
88,Retweet my question. I want an answer. The world wants to know. #RoeVWade https://t.co/T75R0WTl1W
89,@tatereeves Yes or no. Would you sign legislation banning contraception? Yes or no? #alden4liberty  just answer the question.
90,@tatereeves Answering the question with a simple yes or no would’ve prevented this. It was a very direct question that you still haven’t answered.
91,It went from “ban abortion!” to “ban birth control!” real quick. #BirthControl
92,"MS will ban abortion if Roe is overturned, and our only abortion clinic will move to New Mexico. I’ve seen what desperate people are willing to do to terminate pregnancies. I’m anti-homeless women using screw drivers and middle schoolers drinking bleach."
93,Not everything in life is sunshine and rainbows. There are states that won’t sell syringes to heroin addicts. My question is “why?” They may break that addiction one day. There’s no sense in promoting the spread of HIV and Hep C as some sort of punishment.
94,"@Olianderman @protraviso Republicans told me that I was helping to elect the Democrat, and Democrats told me that I was helping to elect the Republican. It’s just a passive aggressive way to get you to vote the way that they want you to."
95,@Heather27207971 @GwinnettLiberty @ShannonBrayNC It’s the same in South Mississippi. My candidacy has come with plenty of threats directed towards me. I feel that it’s worth it.
96,@Heather27207971 @GwinnettLiberty @ShannonBrayNC Your vote always counts. Don’t let anybody convince you otherwise.
97,"@mamabird1920 @LPNational Biden and Trump are the same. Democrats made the laws that over criminalize behavior, and now the Republicans are taking advantage of those laws. They are the same."
98,"I’m the only candidate certified to be on the ballot so far In Mississippi’s 4th District. Follow me on Facebook, and share the heck out of my posts. https://t.co/V4RrW5eVj4"
99,Generations of voting for the “lesser of two evils” has gotten us to this point.
