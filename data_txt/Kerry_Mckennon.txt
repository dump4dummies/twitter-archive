What does Liberty mean to you? https://t.co/raOrlRfOA9"
59,The 2nd Amendment means all citizens have the right to purchase and bear arms. It also means there should be no prohibitions. John Cornyn supports regulations on gun sales. Does he really believe in the 2nd Amendment? #freedomuncaged #openKerry https://t.co/qs8P5O8ijV

6) Insist on better treatment of people detained at the border. This includes keeping families together and ending the caging of children."
69,"3) Ensure that people's civil rights are still protected in jail. This includes trans individuals.

4) Bring our troops home to protect our borders as they were intended instead of occupying other countries. This will help reduce the burden to our veterans."
70,"1) ending qualified immunity so our officers are held accountable for their actions.

2) Ending the unsuccessful war on drugs by legalizing them. This will also help reduce the # of people sitting in jail for victimless crimes."

78,"We welcome the news of the signing of agreements to normalize relations between the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel. This is a small step towards stability in the region. The establishment of Arab and Bahrain embassies in Israel could lead to more open and constructive dialogue."
