15,@DBCooperPodcast I see my man Sheridan Peterson on the cover.
16,@DrBobEdwards1 This response is standard FBI modus operandi. They said the same thing regarding my FOIA request pertaining to Cooper‚Äôs tie. But then last October I visited FBI HQ in DC and saw the tie. What to make of this???

24,"@DrBobEdwards1 Two important points: 1) The Cinebar hunting grounds are east of Cinnabar. 2) The closest the FBI Flight Path gets to the hunting grounds‚Äîthe extreme NE corner‚Äîis 10 miles. Moreover, the minimum drift (from 225 degrees) would have been 18 miles‚Äîto the extreme SW corner."

30,"@Empty_Frames @CrawlspaceMedia @Crawlspacepod @TimPilleri @LReenstierna One thing that I realized after listening to the podcast was that my math was completely off. Indeed, 300K is .0015% of $200MM, not 15%. Therefore, a 300K commission is completely plausible. In my mind this only strengthens McDevitt as a credible suspect."
