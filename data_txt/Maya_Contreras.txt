5,"My husband and I are two of those 86,890 votes. I suspect splitting the Congressional primary races away from these local and statewide races produced that low turnout, but yikes, there are approx 13.5 million registered statewide voters, of that 5.5 million are in NYC. Oof. https://t.co/o1ihT4x8L9"

40,"2. You can watch my video ""Words to Fire"" about this. It was my NYU presentation on historical American narratives. Also, yes, I had fun putting it together so some of it's silly, but these are cultivated narratives by the Right Wing used to harm us. https://t.co/NSoOrD1ltT"
41,"1. I know everyone wishes the Democrats were a PR agency. They're not. However, they should have a better-messaging apparatus. The Right-Wing have used advertisers, media, textbooks, &amp; Think Tanks for years to cultivate messaging/policy meant to harm women &amp; marginalized groups. https://t.co/lx9ue3l93o https://t.co/OgRRJzaXcX"
42,"@AmandiOnAir Hi Fernand,
Agree it feels craven to have Dems sending out texts fundraising off of Roe getting overturned, 2 things: it costs millions of dollars to successfully run for Congress (it shouldn't we need to pass #ForThePeopleAct) and Dems have codified Roe, it passed the House. https://t.co/7fLp4T9gGq"
43,"@rxmart2 @djcsharp_dmv @groove_sdc Yep! I understand she's frustrated with fundraising off Abortion, if felt a little craven to get 50 texts this week from politicians about it but unfortunately, it costs about $1 million+ dollars to run for Congress and Dems do have a bill to codify Roe that passed in the House. https://t.co/wJnMc97VTZ"
