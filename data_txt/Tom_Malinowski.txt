0,"After Ida, I pushed for and got the funding needed to finally complete the Army Corps' Green Brook basin flood control project, decades after it was first proposed. The bipartisan infrastructure bill will bring even more work like this to New Jersey. https://t.co/IAxxd6YizR"
1,"Here's a great example of how infrastructure can protect us from flooding.

Last May, the Army Corps of Engineers built a new railway culvert near the Green Brook in Somerset County.

Here it is 3 months later diverting Ida flood waters that might otherwise have hit many homes. https://t.co/5G1uCaynUe"
2,"With the Supreme Court set on repealing the 20th Century, people have been asking me what can be done.

It’s simple.

Elect 2 more Senators willing to reform the filibuster to do what the vast majority of Americans want. And don’t forget to hold the House.

Everyone can help!"
3,"The lesson is clear.

A lot of Americans sat out 2016, and we got a Supreme Court that shredded Roe v Wade. We exercised our civic duty in 2018 &amp; 2020, and got a Congress that has reached for and often attained real progress.

Speak out. Organize. And vote!"
4,"Something good happened yesterday, too - we enacted the first law to shield kids from gun violence in 30 years.

A word of caution: while this was truly bipartisan in the Senate, it wouldn’t even have gotten a vote in the House if we hadn’t elected a Democratic majority there. https://t.co/vJDGTNjdH9"
5,"I support Roe v. Wade, and will keep working to enshrine it into law.

My opponent Tom Kean Jr. voted against codifying Roe in New Jersey, and would help bring about a House GOP majority that will pass a nationwide ban.

The stakes in this election could not be more clear."
6,"Moreover, Republicans have told us that if they regain their Congressional majority, they will try to pass a nationwide abortion ban, which would overturn our New Jersey law. There can be no doubt any more that they mean what they say."
7,"New Jersey law may still protect a woman's right to choose. But America is one country. How many of us have daughters, sisters, loved ones and dear friends living, working, or studying in states where women and doctors will now be treated as criminals for seeking an abortion?"

11,@stellab06612856 @ScottMStedman That’s exactly what this does.
12,Our lax rules against dirty foreign money not only help crooks like Putin. The loot that enters our system corrupts our politics and drives up prices (especially real estate) for law abiding Americans. I look forward to getting this legislation to President Biden soon.
13,"Great news — we got my bipartisan Enablers Act, the biggest upgrade in our anti-money laundering laws in 20 years, into the annual defense bill.

This will make it much harder for the world’s crooks and kleptocrats to hide their money in America. https://t.co/lihfJX40UH"
14,"BTW, after Putin invaded Ukraine, my GOP colleagues rightly demanded that Biden ban Russian oil. I remember asking them to pledge that if Biden did so, they would not immediately attack him for the higher gas prices that would inevitably result. I guess that was a naive request!"
15,I would support a federal + state gas tax holiday if we can be assured the savings will be passed down to consumers. I've also long urged a temporary tax on oil companies' massive windfall profits to help pay for this. https://t.co/NTMNYiqfLE

17,"This is a significant step forward, one the Senate repeatedly refused to take over the past several years. 

It’s heartbreaking that it took another tragedy, but the last two elections were not in vain.

Now let’s set our sights even higher. https://t.co/p5skYtqMTm"
18,"Despite all the advantages you gave him, Tom Kean Jr couldn’t even get a majority of Republicans to vote for him as their candidate. So good luck! https://t.co/7qg8T5fA9B"
19,"Wonder what the @NJGOP thinks of its sister party in Texas officially declaring the 2020 election invalid, or the leading GOP Senate candidate in Missouri putting out an ad inciting terrorism against moderate Republicans.
It's voting vs violence in 2022.

Meanwhile, I want to ensure that our democracy will remain. Whatever our disagreements on policy, lets elect leaders who'll fight for that."
22,"That's why it matters that my opponent Tom Kean Jr. has run away from questions about Jan. 6. You'd think he'd be standing up for Pence, Cheney, and the Republicans of his father's generation who put country over party.

Instead all he says is that he ""supports the Trump agenda."""

43,"I think the Moderate Party will appeal to many Americans who no longer feel a home in the election denying, vaccine rejecting, Capitol rioting wing of the GOP, but who also aren't ready to identify as Democrats."
44,"It will enable moderate voters to pull the lever for a Democrat, but under a banner that better reflects their values, while giving Republicans an incentive to compete for their support again. It will restore the influence that our gerrymandered, polarized system has denied them."
