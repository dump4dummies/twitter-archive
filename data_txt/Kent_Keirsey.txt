0,"Proud of our Supreme Court this week. They stood up  for democracy and states' rights (NC voter ID), protected our right to bear arms, and finally put an end to 50 years of bad precedent that undermined our democracy by overturning Roe - potentially saving millions of lives."
1,"@Ballymagibbon @KeirseyKent Dave, the point is if we are going to fix inflation we need to stop pouring gas on the fire.  Price caps won't help.  None of the things Biden is proposing will help. They will all make it worse.  Also, sorry to break this to you - the primary is over, I didn't win."
2,"Happy Father's Day! Proud son and dad here.  Grateful for the example my dad set. He is the toughest man alive and showed us what it meant to live a life of service, be a man of character, and have some fun and adventure along the way.  I do my best to follow his example. https://t.co/xiaf0ewgWY"
3,"@Ballymagibbon @KeirseyKent And keep your eye out.  Most regulatory barriers to entry are sold as ways to protect consumers, but are really crafted by lobbyists and protect industry incumbents.  This is why deregulation is hard and thankless, but important."
4,"@Ballymagibbon @KeirseyKent I'm no insulin market expert, but if thats the case we don't need a price cap.  If prices are too high then others will enter the market and prices should come down.  If not, price caps will hurt supply.  If barriers, they're likely regulatory. This is where deregulation may help"
5,"Biden is the George Costanza of presidents - all of his instincts are wrong.  To stop inflation he wants to shrink the economy, spend more, raise taxes, set price caps, and drain oil reserves. Do the opposite! Spend less, lower taxes, and deregulate.

6,"Disappointing loss yesterday, but I'm proud of the race we ran and grateful to our team and all our supporters. Thank you! The mission is more important than one election.  Our country deserves competent leaders of character, and that only happens if people step up to serve."
7,"Election Day is here! Thank you to all our supporters! Let’s do everything we can to get folks out to vote today. Call everyone you know. If we break 30% we beat the runoff. Let’s do this!
