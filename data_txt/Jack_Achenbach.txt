0,Would you donate to a campaign if you knew what they were spending your money on? Are you at all concerned that their spending habits will reflect in how they decide to use your tax dollars in office?
1,"@ChurchWatkinsIV Thank you for the kind words! Remember, you can always donate. Right now, donations are only going towards advertising materials.  https://t.co/kzmVppvCvr"

3,@ScottFist @Fla_Pol We can see that you opened the email we sent to you several days ago.
4,@orlandosentinel Our campaign is running for the same seat. Why do only criminal politicians get a spotlight?
5,"Our campaign collected over 3,100 petitions from Floridians to put us on the ballot. Corrine Brown cashed a check at the last minute. No one asked for her to be their voice. https://t.co/5TlXHwn006"
6,"@JeffBurlew Our campaign collected over 3,100 petitions from Floridians to put us on the ballot. Corrine Brown cashed a check at the last minute. No one asked for her to be their voice."
7,"No candidates propped up by any institution has the people in mind. No candidate that cuts a check to run for office has the people at heart. Our campaign has defied every obstacle, our campaign does not rest, our campaign does not give up because we fight for you."
8,@news6wkmg We've been running in this district for over a year and not once have you reported on our campaign. Now you decide to run an article on a convicted felon who decides to run on the last day of the qualifying period.
9,"@Fla_Pol @ScottFist Odd that you refuse to cover our campaign citing there being far to many candidates in the field, yet find the time to cover two candidates who joined the race at the last minute. Florida Politics, I think not."
10,@wjxt4 We've been running in this district for over a year and not once have you reported on our campaign. Now you decide to run an article on a convicted felon who decides to run on the last day of the qualifying period.

12,@Fla_Pol @AlanGrayson @ScottFist 2 days before the deadline Alan Grayson joins the race. Alan Grayson has represented district 8 &amp; 9.

24,"and foremost, but we also actually show up to represent Floridians. 

Don't let the established, wealthy, fame hungry politicians fool you any longer into voting for someone who turns their back on you the moment they win their popularity contest."
25,"1) Astounding that candidate Allek Pastrana, Jennifer, and I were able to make it to two events yesterday while none of the other candidates running for District #10 could be bothered to show up at just one, yet again. Our campaign not only focuses on kitchen table issues first https://t.co/AdFIB4clhj"
26,"Not sure why this photo is sooo blurry, but I had a great time meeting up with @cbradleyfl and the Democratic Veterans Caucus for the Veterans Stand Down event on Saturday! I hope we can elect more politicians that keep their word to help our veterans! https://t.co/G3Sw2Q4OMr"
27,Everyone who argued that Twitter can do whatever they want because they're a private platform will now suddenly reverse their position.
28,"The ""block"" button exists. Thus, any top down control of communication is unnecessary. Yet, while the individual has the power to control their surroundings, they refuse to do so. Desiring rather to control the means of communication outright for all."
29,"Allek Pastrana, Jennifer (behind the camera) and I had a great time petitioning at the Caribbean Fusion Fest on Sunday! https://t.co/WQfXbz8hQl"

31,Happy Earth Day from Lake Eola. Had a great day petitioning with @allekpastrana and meeting with constituents! https://t.co/zlDDvrbWUC
32,"According to Frost's team at the event, he couldn't attend because he was busy fundraising in California. While legal, campaigning outside of ones state is highly unethical. Why does a campaign that raised $500k need support from non-Floridians? https://t.co/8nYNrLVwdb"
33,It's absurd to see politicians in parades. Waving down to their subjects from on high. Out of reach from those they represent.
34,How dare they hold an election when Democracy is at stake! Won't someone think of the Democracy!? (sarcasm) https://t.co/Ki4fNJFu2X
35,All politicians are self-serving egotists.
36,The barriers to entry into the political arena are purposefully high. Those with wealth and connections can easily bypass the busy work of petitioning constituents for signatures to get a head start advertising their platform. Why vote for any politician that pays to play?
37,"I've met far too many candidates running for office on the platform of ""for the people"" but act as though their run for office is all about themselves."
38,All policies should require an expiration date and metrics by which to evaluate its impact to determine whether said policy should be upheld or discontinued.
39,"The same people enacting policy to supplement the ethical values lost due to the deterioration of community cohesion do nothing to ensure that their positions are not sought by those running for all the wrong reasons (fame, fortune, and power)."
40,Politicians should make no more than what they were making prior to holding office. Running for office should not be a lottery ticket to a higher lifestyle. Too many run for the prize money knowing they can hide behind the work of the other hundreds of representatives.

51,Everyone asking you to sacrifice for the war in Ukraine can afford it. Everyone who asked you to sacrifice for the last two years during Covid could afford it. When do they hold up the end of the bargain?
52,Running for office you notice that more people are willing to Tweet about the downfall of Democracy than actively engage in it.
53,"2) candidates throughout Florida, regardless of political affiliation. Real change starts with making other voices heard."
54,"1) The RNC, DNC and their chapters are equally responsible for our poor leadership in office. Both stand idly by throughout the primary season, providing support only to the victor thereafter. Our campaign has worked tirelessly providing no-cost services to other grassroots"
