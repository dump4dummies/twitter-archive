20,This morning I was able to attend the Lincoln Day Breakfast held by the @WasatchGOP. It was wonderful to hear from local leaders and I was honored to meet @beckyforutah and @SenatorRomney. That meeting gave me hope for the future of Utah and the Utah Republican Party! #utpol
21,"RT @elonmusk: The duty of a leader is to serve their people, not for the people to serve them"
22,@DiscountGandalf I’m definitely a Republican. Being non-discriminatory should never be a partisan thing. In the Declaration of Independence it says all men are created equal and I believe that to truly be American we need to treat everyone as if they were created equal.
23,This is why I’m running for office. We need more of this #utpol https://t.co/IkJXjP2qJj
24,"Discrimination goes against the teachings of most if not all Christian churches. Using your religious beliefs as an excuse to treat someone else poorly is not Christianity. God loves everybody, all of His children. So should we. 3/3 #utpol #BYU"
25,"You don’t need to agree with the actions/lifestyle of another person, but there is never a good reason to discriminate. We all deserve the same fair treatment by others. We all deserve to feel welcome. 2/"
26,Just because the investigation into BYU for their treatment of LGBTQ+ people has been dropped does not mean that it is okay for members of @Ch_JesusChrist to justify discrimination because of religious beliefs. #utpol #BYU 1/

35,@briahsdad @GovCox It’s disturbing that John Curtis hasn’t said anything about it either. We need better representation in Utah’s 3rd District. #utpol
36,@briahsdad @GovCox I don’t agree with it. The Republican Party should not be defending the actions of the rioters or censuring those willing to investigate what happened. It’s a dangerous direction for the Republican Party.
37,"Utah’s 3rd Districts deserves a representative who will not remain silent on important issues. 
A politician who chooses not to speak out on things such as what the RNC said on Thursday is more worried about their job than they are about the people they represent #utpol #RNC"
38,@TannerAinge @MikeLeeforUtah @RNC @RepKinzinger @RepLizCheney @GOP I would also like to hear from @RepJohnCurtis about this. He has remains unnervingly silent about this and many other important issues.
39,@UTDHC @RepBurgessOwens @JakeHunsaker @VoteDarlene @RepJohnCurtis The interesting thing is that Curtis is reporting his fundraising but he hasn’t even officially thrown his hat into the race yet.

61,"@SharonGF_NBCT Agreed. My incumbent, @RepJohnCurtis, has just been complicit and silent. That silence is part of the problem"
62,@SharonGF_NBCT I think you’re missing my point. I agree with you. This is why I’m running for office. Being anti-Dem is the weakest stance a Republican can have.
63,@SharonGF_NBCT It’s awful. And many Republican senators and representatives are the same way.
64,"@SharonGF_NBCT I agree with you, and I stand with Romney and Cheney and Kinzinger. That’s the type of Republican I am. And I know many republicans who agree with us. It’s the leaders of the party, and many others in office, who are a problem and they need to be changed out"

76,@1Eyed_ShihTzu @LMB_Esquire @gopTODD This is far from what it means to have a normal supply. Sarcasm like this doesn’t do anyone any good.
77,@LMB_Esquire @gopTODD There’s a few ways to do this. You can open up more ports that have closed/cut hours because of COVID. You can expand the size of ports. You can incentivize truck drivers. Etc.
78,@LMB_Esquire @gopTODD that make up the supply chain would make a big difference down the line. Those are things that he isn’t doing 2/2 #utpol
79,"@LMB_Esquire @gopTODD He doesn’t have direct control for those things, but there are definitely actions he could take to help mitigate it. He doesn’t have “quick fix” options, but things like opening up the supply chain and supporting (maybe even incentivizing) the businesses 1/2"

91,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah I do see what’s going on. You’re misunderstanding me, but I don’t think you intend to understand. 
I won’t bend or give in to Democrat ideas. As I said before, I will strongly defend conservative values."
92,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah My goal is to progress politics, and just because I’m unwilling to treat others down doesn’t mean I’m not a Conservative."
93,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah That’s unfortunate. I’ve been a Republican all my life, unlike the incumbent John Curtis. I didn’t say I support democrat ideas. I’m saying there are solutions we haven’t looked at because people are more loyal to their party than they are to their values."
94,"@realuncledenden @CC_Utah In my case, it means I’m not extreme, I’m not far right. 
I’m a conservative who will work to preserve conservative values. I’m also planning to work to find solutions to issues that both democrats and republicans can agree on."
