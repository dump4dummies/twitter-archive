9,"@DirtRoadie @Stephen81401 😂 If you guys would really like to have a discussion about this, feel free to drop into our monthly CD3 meetings at any time. @LaPlataDems can get you the info."
10,@Stephen81401 @DirtRoadie @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo I have no problem with independents voting for whomever they would like in the primary. I’ve made my points about why unregistering for this purpose is a poor strategy to get the best representation in CD3.
11,"@Stephen81401 @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo A. Boebert, B. Doesn’t matter, will vote with McCarthy and R’s either way, C. It does, instead of working to grow the Democratic base and engage with the community to win Dem votes from U voters, volunteers are focusing on persuasion to vote in the R primary."
12,"@Stephen81401 @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo Democrats actively involved in the party lose their ability to participate when they unregister, particularly in elected and volunteer positions within the party. Resources critical to voter registration and community engagement are thus redirected. This is purely a distraction."
13,"@Stephen81401 @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo While Boebert is clearly a loud-mouthed idiot, who in no way is a good representative for our district, she has absolutely no power in Congress and will vote lock-step with the Republican Party. Electing Coram won’t change that, we need to unite and invest in flipping this seat."
14,"@Stephen81401 @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo In today’s divided government, voting party over person is most important and we have an obligation to elect Democrats to stand up for women’s rights, voting rights, and all of the policies we know best support the residents of CD3."
15,@Stephen81401 @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo Encouraging conservative leaning unaffiliated voters to oust Boebert in a primary is fine. Unregistering as a Democrat to vote in the Republican primary pulls resources and upends the party infrastructure needed to elect a Democratic representative for CD3.
16,@Stephen81401 This is a shortsighted and poorly thought out strategy. @DurangoHerald @LaPlataDems @indivisibledgo
