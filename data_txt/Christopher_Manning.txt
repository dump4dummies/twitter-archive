2,@mtaibbi What was her slogan for the campaign again? It seemed to change every month.
3,@Anne_oyed @yhazony @bethanyshondark Still waiting for when the last challenge was to Brown and Loving. What states in our federalist system are trying to overturn those legal precedents?

7,"@Anne_oyed @yhazony @bethanyshondark So they taught you straw man arguments in law school or did you pick that up on Twitter? Yes I'm all for that. Tell me Ms. Anne Esq. can you tell me when the last challenges to Brown and Loving were? Oh I understand it well, and what a crock ""substantive due process"" is."
8,@John_AKA_Becker @schwarz The biggest reason D's give for eliminating the EC is they wrongly believe it gives R's an advantage to elect the president. But I have a memory longer than last week and recall how prior to 2016 ALL the smart people said the EC gave D's the advantage. https://t.co/lr6GOXBeaK
9,@schwarz @John_AKA_Becker Maybe one day you may also understand the concept of presentism and that might help your understanding of historical events. Although this is something I wouldn't hold my breath for.

11,@HillaryClinton Is passing an FBI background check required before getting an abortion? Also are there any state and federal programs which subsidize the purchase of said AR-15?
12,@rickygervais It was a great set. I enjoyed it a lot.
13,@schwarz @John_AKA_Becker of who was allowed to vote in the states for president. VA may have had the largest population but since it's suffrage was more restrictive than say NY it's absolute population advantage was diminished by NY's more expansive voting rights.
14,@schwarz @John_AKA_Becker So the concern with the direct election of the president was that in the original 13 states who got to vote for the president was very unequal. The issue wasn't about slavery because no slave in any state was going to vote. The issues they had was how to balance the unevenness
15,"@schwarz @John_AKA_Becker In the north most white men could vote whether they owned property or not this wasn't as common in the south. NJ MD and CT originally allowed free black men to vote. So when he talks about suffrage being ""more diffuse"" this is what he meant."
16,@schwarz @John_AKA_Becker I'm sorry you don't have an understanding of voting rights in the north vs south in 1787. It wasn't just white men voted black people didn't. In the south it was generally white men w/ property who were allowed to vote but in NJ a woman w/ property could vote.

26,"@schwarz I think Madison got this right. In my perfect world the House is expanded to 593, we have multi-member districts, ranked choice voting, and we eliminate winner take all. Each elector votes for the winner in their district, and the statewide winner get the 2 votes for the Senators"
27,@schwarz https://t.co/GeO1bwnP2t
28,@schwarz Even years later when amendments to the constitution were being proposed Madison didn't advocate for direct popular election. He wanted to keep the electors but eliminate the winner take all method and instead have each district elector cast the vote for their top 2 candidates.
29,@schwarz And Madison was in the extreme minority. Almost NOBODY at the convention supported direct election of the President. To try and say this was what the founders really wanted when in fact it was Madison and 2-3 other delegates is dishonest.

51,"@michelletandler This is always the flaw in the argument in favor of abortion logically. As you recognize life begins at conception. Therefore, an abortion is the taking of a life, a decision not made by the child, it is an act imposed upon another human, not a woman's own body."
52,"@michelletandler At what point does that ""liberty"" end? Doesn't a baby delivered at full term still depend on the mother's body for survival? In fact a baby which has been born requires even more of the mother than when still in the womb. The duty of government is to protect life and liberty."
