0,@ryanjreilly We should start calling out everyone that wasn’t at the Capitol.
1,@roddyetwit Wasn’t the guy in the bottom right assaulting a police office and attempting to take his weapon?
2,@NickAdamsinUSA Needs more cover.

6,@JordanOnRecord They’ve arrested more than double the amount arrested for the Fuergeson Riots.
7,@alanfeuer 😂

9,@MacFarlaneNews Look at all the violent shoving and pushing! How do you people take this seriously?
10,@MacFarlaneNews I remember that dude.
11,@JordanOnRecord James Buchanan watched half the country secede from the Union. Woodrow Wilson honored the KKK in the White House. Donald Trump sent out mean tweets.
12,@SeditionHunters https://t.co/el0F4QRm0d
13,@SeditionHunters @BusinessInsider It WAS a fun vacation :)
14,@atdickerson @firstplacereal @dotjenna I’m sure there’s someone out there who cares about you and what you have to say. I hope you find em :)
15,"@MacFarlaneNews Why doesn’t anyone discuss the pipe bombs placed at dem and rep headquarters? It’s a rhetorical question, the media doesn’t discuss it because both parties headquarters were targeted which doesn’t fit their narrative of a Republican encouraged terrorist attack."
16,"@firstplacereal @atdickerson @dotjenna Probably can prove libel against any mainstream hosts who refers to you as a terrorist, especially following sentencing. They know terrorism is not misdemeanor, ergo they are knowingly causing harm and defaming your character. Worst case get a settlement."
17,@MacFarlaneNews https://t.co/WMCUOWmlfJ
18,"@no1listened @MichaelBindner @MacFarlaneNews Apparently it is now. We incarcerate more people than communist china. As you can see by the comments, our dissent into totalitarianism is being celebrated."
19,@MacFarlaneNews If only the barber took a little off the top of Nancy Pelosi 💈
20,@dotjenna The Capitol Riot is the best thing that ever happened to me. Never had so much fun.
21,"@GlennInvestor @dotjenna Actually quite a few do, they just don’t flock to social media projecting their aggression."

25,@atdickerson @dotjenna @firstplacereal Doesn’t make up for the ugliness inside of you. I hope you find happiness.
26,"@atdickerson @dotjenna @firstplacereal 3 vs. 16 months obsessively harassing someone because they walked into a building. It’s concerning, unless you’re operating a fake account in which case how do I get that job?"
27,@atdickerson @dotjenna @firstplacereal You need more positivey in your life
28,@MacFarlaneNews If he wore a BLM shirt the media would be calling him a hero. And if he got shot? Forget about it.

33,@MacFarlaneNews Man that day was fun.
34,@MacFarlaneNews “He wielded a stick.” The prosecution has a sense of humor at least.
35,@KenCox @MacFarlaneNews I should of asked to finish the semester. Three weeks of course work in 6 days 🙄
36,@MacFarlaneNews 4 months isn’t too bad. Be out in time for 2024 🇺🇸🎉
37,"There was an insurrection on January 6th, and it succeeded."
38,@gregkellyusa Trump’s what the doctor ordered!
39,@ANNSISCO1 “Covid controls”
40,@MacFarlaneNews @CBSMornings Are you a scarecrow?
41,@MacFarlaneNews It’s one error repeated three times.
42,@MacFarlaneNews It’s literally people standing around lol
43,@ZoeTillman We love you baked Alaska!
44,@ryanjreilly We all believe he’s innocent.
45,@ryanjreilly He did nothing wrong.
46,@kyledcheney Hope you beat them brother.
47,@ericswalwell We were close to stopping the steal. And now the countries in the shitter 😥
48,@TuckerCarlson Welcome back! They’re locking me up for 90 days! New life as a Republican 🥵 https://t.co/nNowsB4J4M
49,@JennyLynnHere @MacFarlaneNews @January6thCmte I’d hate to be reminded I murdered Ashli Babbitt too…..
50,@MacFarlaneNews We’re incarcerating for clapping now 🙄
51,@MacFarlaneNews The audacity of a mob using the mob mentality defense…..

53,@CoryCullington https://t.co/aqPW6ZERj6
54,@MacFarlaneNews Show the pictures of the cops shooting tear gas at the peaceful protestors BEFORE it turned into a riot.

59,@atdickerson @greasyfingerz52 @dotjenna As Americans we sure do but we’ll get through it. No matter how hard you people try to divide us.
60,@greasyfingerz52 @atdickerson @dotjenna I’m trying to highlight the many similarities between us. Help guide you through your ignorance.
61,@atdickerson @greasyfingerz52 @dotjenna When you’re under attack seems like a good time to use it.
62,@greasyfingerz52 @atdickerson @dotjenna I can point at the blinders but I can’t force you to take ‘em off. Worth a shot though 🤷🏿‍♀️
63,"@greasyfingerz52 @atdickerson @dotjenna Every race, religion, and sexual orientation is represented in the subjected minority we’re talking about."
64,@girlsreallyrule We’re trying to save future women’s bodies.
65,@atdickerson @dotjenna You people?
66,@Gerardo3791 @dotjenna @firstplacereal This strategy is so elementary. If you love her so much trying sending a letter or some flowers.
67,"@jc4real35 @dotjenna And here you are giving it to her. We need pawns like you, thanks :)"
68,@cant_happening @dotjenna You have an interesting way of showing it. I tend not to talk to people I’m avoiding.
69,@atdickerson @dotjenna It would be an accurate representation of your social media. Hostile and intrusive.
70,@JerrodYork @RandomUser43 @dotjenna @gatewaypundit If she ran again that’d be sweet. 2016 was a very fun year.
71,@RandomUser43 @dotjenna @gatewaypundit Because faith isn’t one sided.
72,@RMyers717 @dotjenna @gatewaypundit Actually our persecution has emboldened us and we look forward to our savior returning to office in 2024 :)
73,"@girlsreallyrule Good for her, sad how people actually take pride in killing babies."
74,"@trishinpa2 @LALewman If you can’t beat them, join them."
75,@cracraone @LALewman @SunnyBlondie @SenatorHassan @SenatorShaheen How’d those complaints work out?

80,@wyldepepper @MacFarlaneNews Not a Kathy Griffin fan then lol
81,@CoryCullington @kyledcheney @alanfeuer https://t.co/e7IzlK8mMl
82,@CoryCullington @kyledcheney @alanfeuer This whole thing is nonsense. I’m worried it’ll culminate into an actual insurrection if it keeps up.
83,"@kyledcheney @CoryCullington @alanfeuer The liberal media, after reviewing themselves, have found themselves innocent of any wrongdoing."
84,@JordanOnRecord I should of wore a costume.
85,@MacFarlaneNews His t-shirt is a self fulfilling prophecy. Hopefully Biden and the DOJ will be held accountable for this injustice.
86,@JordanOnRecord @ryanjreilly Liars holding liars accountable while they’re recorded and reported by liars.
87,@MacFarlaneNews Clapped and deleted Facebook?! Ted Bundy over here.
88,@JordanOnRecord He did less than I did and got four years. This whole thing is a joke and when a real insurrection actually happens I hope everyone remembers how they treated their fellow citizens.
89,@SmachTheresa @MacFarlaneNews Don’t forget Facebook. It isn’t a real insurrection unless the perpetrators map out their plans on Facebook beforehand.
90,@MacFarlaneNews I partied in there! Good times 😇 https://t.co/un3dFhS4kz
91,@AIC0U812 @dotjenna @firstplacereal That’s ok they don’t want child molesters in their neighborhood. You’re fine where you are.
92,@atdickerson @dotjenna @firstplacereal It’s out of your price range. People like you tend to have more time than money.
93,@Gerardo3791 @dotjenna @firstplacereal Stop following her if her success bothers you so much.
94,@MacFarlaneNews Imagine if everything we said became court documents?
95,@MacFarlaneNews My only regret is we gave the Capitol back.
96,"@CoryCullington Holocaust deniers would use survivors interviews as evidence. Frequently a survivor would confuse what camp they had been held in and agree to the wrong question. Congratulations, you’re practicing holocaust denier techniques."
97,@CoryCullington You obviously know best 🤷🏿‍♀️
98,@CoryCullington https://t.co/5h1DUeZNkL
99,@CoryCullington Oh and for your followers 😉
