0,It would be great to have some specifics. Standard politician speaking without meaning. Which policies? What democrats? SAY SOMETHING. https://t.co/byzezKRcKM
1,What right have you to command the labors of a physician or nurse. The argument that healthcare is a right is akin to an argument for slavery. We must reform the system to foster a reduction in prices not hijack the system to do our bidding. https://t.co/D0UMfI5haK
2,We the people of the United States formally accept your letter of resignation. https://t.co/Pj84mzL4qm
3,"If the tragedy of the #BuffaloAttack is the grounds for this conclusion then i can only infer you have not read his manifesto. This man was a crackpot socialist.
And if the #GOP is to be saved then I am glad to loose a charlatan #RINO such as you. https://t.co/uhacFSs6Kn"
4,It would seem that our politicians as of the past few decades have grown evermore illiterate. The #democrats have on many occasions drafted bills of enormous size and impact and given scarcely any more time than to read the cover before calling it to a vote. #readthebill
5,"And how sir, would you expect a nation engaged in total war to finance such a purchase. As usual your sentiment prevails where your reason faulters. Please attempt to make better arguments in future. https://t.co/FQ9IT76nkN"
6,"Such actions yield poor results toward inflation. Allow me to adjust your grand standing. Instruct the fed to hold the presses, raise interest rates and stop giving money to foreign powers. You cannot avoid this recession. Manage the pain now instead of permitting fate to fester. https://t.co/BA6q3gWvxb"
7,"@jennofaspyville @JohnMoolenaar Although I agree with the substance of your statement and love to see it come about, I must humbly contest its implication that this is a matter with which the federal government can be trusted. Our elections do need fortification however  t'is not the charge of the office I seek"
8,"Although my sympathies lie with the people of Ukraine, I cannot say in good conscience that I condone the gifting by congress such a substantial sum. Least of all during a time of great domestic instability. With shortages and price hikes the American people deserve first nod."
9,"RT @21FrankS: BREAKING: Kentucky Derby winner Rich Strike turns down a meeting with @JoeBiden . Asked why, they said “If I wanted to see a…"
10,@graceisforyou The communist manifesto
11,Well its about time we got off the fence and stood for something. #RINOs https://t.co/tDHRrWmHdk
12,"Here we have featured some cinemas greatest legends. On the right Moe, on the left Larry and down the center Shemp. RIP Curly. Ladies and Gentlemen the Three Stooges have taken the main stage. The only thing left to ask is who's on first? #Leftists https://t.co/k8EVCXRtQ6"
13,"The only praise that comes to mind is his demonstration that when the left finds itself with free reign, catastrophe is an inevitability. We should thank this administration for the approaching crimson typhoon in november. #RedWave2022 https://t.co/kWpaTCAbVn"
14,"I cannot recall a single instance in which a Ministry of truth has ever been anything other than an indicator of totalitarian #tyranny
 The #DHS has only serviced this nation in the function of vilifying the people as the enemy of themselves.  We deserve better institutions."
15,I wish you and your father all the best sir. Although you are my adversary in this campaign that does not detract from our common humanity. God be with you https://t.co/TIzgu16UsG
16,At first perhaps but the writings of Locke Smith and Jefferson prove far more robust not only 'gainst the shroud of history's vast tomes but also in the universality of their everlasting truths. #History #BASED https://t.co/rEDg6IDML6
17,RT @ChristianWalk1r: We already have a flag that represents everyone. It’s called the American flag. F*ck the rainbow. https://t.co/HhpbMI8…
18,@ImWatson91 Well I'm no biologist but my human intuition tells me a man is an adult human male. Its almost like this has been ingrained in me by thousands of generations of basic sense. I suppose absolute has a pesky way of working out like that. #TruthMatters
19,Am I the only candidate in this race not interested in being governor https://t.co/JFM8uuw7xl
20,As candidates for Federal office neither you nor I have the right to weigh in on issues exclusively in the jurisdiction of the state. @JohnMoolenaar if you truly wish to address #voterID then stand for governor. We cannot claim this power for Washington. #federalism #StatesRights https://t.co/R0y8Fh6Xzw
21,"RT @gusportela: Did @gretchenwhitmer fix the damn roads like she promised? 

No wonder nearly 60% of Michiganders want a new Governor. http…"
22,@BITMONGTOSHI @Travisfarrell22 @monyluvsme_paul @Stanglife2 The question is not whether your government will permit you to leave but rather whether ours will accept you. I have little doubt that the peoples of the northern planes will take you in. You have only to carry yourself across. Trudeau's decrees be damned.
23,"The value of incumbents is the experience they have acquired through their tenure. However, what good is that experience when it isn't applied effectively. This August when considering whether to reelect @RepMoolenaar ask this question. Is he the form of #Republican you want?"
24,"Never before have I seen ""Trial by Error"" used as a default. The very personification of catastrophe is calling on the people he's abandoned to blame #Trump for the problems he created while embracing his platform. #Biden #Hypocrisy https://t.co/s4fIIVlnAU"
25,Welcome to the fight fellow countryman https://t.co/UaeU4f55KE
26,It is with great shame that I see my fellow countryman's attitudes toward #Russian people sour. Have we not learned our lesson with the Japanese in WWII. This war is a product of Putin and his govt. not his people. #PutinsWar #NeverAgain #DontBlameThePeople
27,Meeting with newaygo grassroots today. It is the people who matter most. I will go were they go.
28,Our primary goal when it comes to foreign affaires ought be to minimize our dependence on external parties for both resources and development. This nation must become energy independent and self reliant. If this were the case our view of #Ukraine would be of far less concern.
29,RT @MIGOP: .@JoeBiden and @gretchenwhitmer  have forced higher gas prices on Michiganders – and we still expect them to rise. Michiganders…
30,"If anyone is interested I have completed the survey for @ballotpedia , I hope this isn't too repetitious"
31,I would Like to Report that @ballotpedia has officially recognized my candidacy. I would like to Thank them at this time for doing so. In addition if you would like to reach out to assist my campaign you can now find us over on ActiVote.
32,RT @GabeGuidarini: Every economic action the US takes against Russia just pushes them further into China’s economic sphere. The end result…
33,There is nothing more democratic than overthrowing the govt. Democracy is the organized process of routinely doing so. It is only when a govt. condemns the process that it begins to break down. Democracy does not die because your side lost. #Democracy #Patriots https://t.co/TCAHV3KMpc
34,One of the great problems with our society is a profound lack of financial literacy not only with our children but our politicians as well. Until we elect people capable of having adult conversations about math we will never prosper. #DrainTheSwamp #education
35,Why then would you levy a tax on the poorest of us to bailout the richest. The problem is that you and your acolytes have sold the younger generations a bill of goods. You have made college the only path from poverty. And in so doing have trapped the young in a life of slavery. https://t.co/NbDiP1DULc
36,The necessity to revoke those laws which have eroded the #2ndAmendment is of the utmost importance. In the days of this nations founding private vessels fitted with canon were regarded as an asset not a mark of terrorism. In congress I will fight to reclaim what has been stolen.
37,@JustinTrudeau ought examine the logic of his statement. There exists no law by which one can coheres the labors of another. No one need engage in transport yet this PM would for the sake of the economy enslave those who do. This feudal lord ought be removed. #TrudeauTyranny https://t.co/nCutCJPYf0
38,RT @JakeBequette91: The absolute state of our country right now. https://t.co/xOyojrWlq9
39,I sincerely hope the despotism with which you have run your nation does not penetrate the blockade. Those of us to the south of you are committed to the preservation of liberty and human dignity. My fellow countrymen #Resist. #FreedomConvoy . https://t.co/oBwmiCGTOn
40,One must always ask of incumbents what is their intention in their next term that they had not sought in their previous one. @RepMoolenaar must therefore prove himself to be anything other than a creature of the legislature. I am left a skeptic to this end. #PrimaryElection
41,Dept of commerce reported 7.5% #inflation. Inflation is an invisible tax levied on the poorest people in society. More egregious still is that it requires no vote. The #FederalReserve is acting without the consent of the governed. #Bidenflation
42,"The #biden administration has taken it upon itself to distribute courtesy crack pipes and needles to the masses. I would say @POTUS is going for father of the year, save that this program it targeting minorities. Not very #progressive. #BidenIsAFailure"
43,"The brilliance of the constitution is that it divides the attributes of god amongst the body politic. Judge, lawgiver, divine providence. However the source of all authority is placed outside the government severing the sovereign from direct use of its power. #LIBERTY #federalism"
44,The problem with #socialism isn't necessarily an economic one. Rather its greatest threat is its insistence on centralizing authority. Placing all the power into the hands of any single institution inevitably paves the path for every would be tyrant who finds themselves in charge
45,I wouldn't say radical when delusional would fit so much better. People ought be allowed to work for whatever they will. If people are willing to endure poverty for the sake of a position why ought we intrude. If they were unwilling then those low wage positions would erode. https://t.co/n5MDiI5dLv
46,I suppose if one intends on burning the state to the ground for warmth that might work. Although I would posit that this would be a disaster for the environment. #GoGreen #BetotheBeta https://t.co/qrakor2YuD
47,I suppose if one were to select the right #pandemic this statement could be rendered factual. However if his mind has slipped so far as to invoke the age of cholera then the troubles of our age go far beyond this shamble of an #economy. https://t.co/imXsh1eFvr
48,"@MarcoSolorzano8 @ForNorton To paraphrase Coolidge. ""Taxation is nothing other than the forced commitment of a man to spend a portion of his labors in service to the needs of his government rather than the needs of his own pursuits."""
49,For someone seeking federal office to use the campaign stump to make a statement of this kind is a direct violation of #federalism. This is an issue which lies within the exclusive domain of the states. Or is it that the #VotingRightsAct favors the wrong side. https://t.co/xE3BrG4VDs
50,It is with a cheerful heart that I thank @Sen_JoeManchin and @SenatorSinema for fighting to maintain the last vestige of #reason against the greater imbecilic forces of the #Democrats. Congratulations I hope your compatriots take note. #VotingRightsAct
51,Case in point https://t.co/VP8IkdaPbT
52,@ForNorton This demagogic nonsense will not convince anyone with whom you do not already agree. We must as true #conservatives of the cause aim to expand our base not pander to it. #Reason over emotional appeal. And just as a matter if curiosity. How specifically do you plan to combat this?
53,The state of political rhetoric in these modern times has faltered to a disheartening low. If we as #Conservatives must resort to demagogic emotional appeals then we are no better than the #liberal jesters we oppose. We must resist this temptation and stake our claims on #reason.
54,"This must not stand. This action stands in direct violation of our common liberty. It is only through coercion that they aim to pilfer their blasted edicts. We must #Resist. #BoycottCarhartt

55,"It is one the unfortunate truths of our time that #MSM  at large has become consumed by the alluring drug of sensationalism. We must overcome this temptation and speak of things as they are not as we would wish them. #Fauci, #Omicron, #COVID19  https://t.co/EEGjtdidd2"
56,On this day we remember the legacy of #MLK a man dedicated to the proposition that race one day might grow to be of least importance in worth of the individual. It is with pride I call him my fellow countryman. And with shame I see the #Democrats forsake him. #Equality
57,Is any one else concerned with this new #VotingRightsAct. This is a clear ploy to undermine the electorate and devalue the citizen. The feds ought not have this power. There is security in a de centralized system. #StatesRights #Federalism
