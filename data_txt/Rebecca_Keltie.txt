https://t.co/fNEJXfqrMn"
22,@FoxNews @GovRonDeSantis They need deported but I’m good with DeSantis’s decision otherwise. Why would Bumbling Biden be upset? It’s his idea to allow them in illegally. #TeamKeltie #Trump  @GovRonDeSantis @AmericaFirstPAC @SenTedCruz
23,@ChristinaPushaw @cal2024 @NikkiFried @GovRonDeSantis Obviously the American education system has failed her. Maybe she should actually speak to a survivor of the holocaust before she opens her mouth. #AmericaFirst #TeamKeltie #Keltie4Congress @DonaldJTrumpJr @RepMTG
24,@POTUS Historic as in yet another step of destruction of our country by the Democrats. Absolutely shameful.
25,@EdieS @AP No I mean when he tried force and coerced the vaccine on everyone.
26,@FoxNews They should do it! All our politicians live there anyways!
27,Anyone know what happened to the Checks &amp; Balances system between the three branches of government? Seems like the Judicial and Legislative branch are too cozy with the Executive Branch.
28,@elonmusk Very interesting indeed …
29,@RogueAZLatina 🙌
30,On the record…I would never have selected or confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. This will be yet another colossal mistake by the Democrats. Period. @colo_politics @Keltie4Congress
31,@POTUS This is a day that will go down in history as yet another tragic mistake by the Democrats. Period.
32,@POTUS Impartial?
33,@gibodean @POTUS Must be a 1980’s bmw? Those alarms go off allll the time

38,@rondeaulivia This 🙌
39,"@E_Black23 That’s awfully rude of you to assume I only support white Americans. I support all Americans. Black, white, Spanish, immigrant, Asian, etc. = Americans. Stop assuming stuff."
40,@AP International law holds no power. It’s primarily just recommendations right?
41,@POTUS Focus on America!
42,@JoeBiden Oh no…
43,@BernieSanders Well she didn’t stand up for women when she went light on sex offenders.
44,@SenSchumer She needs to enforce the constitution. Not interpret it. That applies to all our Supreme Court Justices.
45,@AP Good
46,@POTUS Oh good god 🤦‍♀️
47,"@DHSgov @DHSBlueCampaign Close. Our. Border. 
That’s how we end human trafficking."
48,@SenTedCruz And sex offenders too.
49,@mikepompeo Consume American energy! 🇺🇸
50,@SenSchumer Woah! How do we know she’s a woman? Let’s not just throw around these pronouns so loosely!
51,@AP Woah how do we know she’s a woman?! Let’s not just toss around these pronouns!!
52,@SenSchumer Ok Chuck
53,@cspan She better be tough on sex offenders.
54,@AP All eyes on her
55,@thehill Oh no
56,@Poodog73 @AP No I get that. But the AG tweeted about it. Like that’s not how you handle it lol
57,@AP They’ll do anything just to get attention. Smh…
58,@POTUS Stop buying oil from enemies. Unleash our energy!

62,"@EdwardC_A @elonmusk What we have is weak leadership that made us lose the Space Force HQ. So yes, I’m gonna pull this. And if I’m elected I’ll try to bring Space X to my district, which in turn will bring jobs, opportunities, innovation, and growth here. Sorry if that’s a problem for you 🤷‍♀️"
63,"@elonmusk If I’m elected, can I get you to come to Colorado?? We could use your jobs!"
64,@ZubyMusic Words of wisdom
65,@VP @KamalaHarris Abortion isn’t a right.
66,"@POTUS This non-partisan, let’s cap insulin. Let’s stop big pharma from exploiting the American people!"
67,"@MMCrypto Ah shoot, here we go"
68,@tedcruz Elon is literally the most free speech person we know
69,@AP Is it just me that sees the irony in Biden fighting for freedom?
70,@DixonYamouf @POTUS No :)
71,@POTUS We’re literally not Biden. You’ve made us worse off than we were.
72,@PhyllisLevin1 @SenSchumer Exactly! Big Pharma is exploiting Americans
73,@SenSchumer Let’s just limit the interest rates. Canceling it is like making college free to them. College isn’t free and People need to be financially responsible.
74,@KKTV11News Oh boy
75,@catturd2 When can I join ? :)
76,"@ZubyMusic I agree, it’s a two way street for sure."
77,@ZubyMusic Liberals can’t understand this.
78,@AmbRice46 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @BrookingsInst @commonwealthfnd Maybe let’s stop spending billions of dollars overseas and invest in America instead!
79,@KamalaHarris Let’s cap the cost of insulin. Let’s lower interest rates. People need the basics.
80,@MMCrypto Rip
81,@catturd2 Careful! They might cancel you 😂
82,@TweetsInTruth @AP It’s called freedom! Some people don’t understand that concept anymore
83,@livefree170171 @AP That’s right ! 🙌
84,@AP Good for her! This is not not ok. Never will be. Not in my America!
85,@stonkRus @POTUS 😢😢
86,@WhiteHouse Stop sending money overseas!
87,"@mogu731 No, because he’s not listening to you."
88,"@DynomiteGM @SumbzTX @POTUS If you read my page, you’ll see I’m adamantly against spending billions of dollars overseas. Oh, but if I say that, I’m a Russian asset for wanting to invest in Americans."
89,@WhiteHouse Unleash American Oil!
90,@thehill @SenSchumer The President and Schumer act like this is their money. It’s the Peoples money! It’s my money! I am not willing to pay for someone else’s party college. Time to work on lowering the cost of higher education instead of condoning it and then forcing us to pay for it. #TeamKeltie
91,"@SumbzTX @POTUS No, I won’t be changing my handle.
It’s not feasible to forgive student loan debt. 
In a perfect world sure, but the world isn’t perfect so 🤷‍♀️"
92,@lorenzoAB90 @POTUS Because I think that Biden isn’t listening to you all and that canceling student debt isn’t feasible? Ok then. I’m all for lowering the rates by the way. More than happy to have a convo with with y’all if you’d like!
93,"@AllenGamble52 @POTUS I agree with that! But canceling it all together, well unfortunately that isn’t feasible"
94,@1SavageCucumber @POTUS Thanks for the follow!
95,@SumbzTX It’s a personal choice to go into college. Canceling student debt isn’t feasible unfortunately. I wish it were but it just isn’t.
96,"@tbb235 @AP Let me flip that on you. 
You tell me what you would do to fix it"
97,@POTUS Y’all in the comments need to stop asking him to cancel student loans. Not gonna happen.
98,@AP Wow…. It’s like we haven’t at problems like this before. Solar isn’t gonna be much better.
99,@BuzzPatterson @Scotus It’s absurd! They should be ashamed if they knew what that meant.
