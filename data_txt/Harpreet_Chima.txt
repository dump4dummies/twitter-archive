2,"@ninaturner Democrats should also see which donors/lobbyists are currently pushing to maintain the filibuster, like the Chamber of Commerce, and denounce them/refund their donations. That's the money that is maintaining the status quo. But we know they'll choose rich donors over our rights."
3,@justhipgnosis Thank you for coming out and for recording the video!
4,@james_roe I think their responses to first losing 1000 seats across the country and then losing to Trump should answer that question. Centrists aren't running for me and you. They're running for their donors. Those folks are doing just fine - a centrist success story.
5,"Abortion rights were kept vulnerable so Democratic leadership could force you to vote for them while they shipped our jobs overseas, bailed out the banks, continue to privatize Medicare, and justify the existence of wealthy donor funded NGOs. It's a deal we should stop taking. https://t.co/yYekxGO1WC"
6,@MattThomasNYC I hope the left someday embraces treating voters like adults and explaining reality to them.
7,"Securing safety &amp; dignity for all will mean wrestling back control of our government not only from the extreme right, but also from billionaires/corporations who do not want to give working people a voice in any matter. It won't be easy, but it is a fight we must wage &amp; win. /end"
8,"In 1860, President Lincoln during his inaugural address expressed this view: ""if the policy of the government, affect the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased, to be their own rulers."" https://t.co/mNoMjrokjo"
9,"Court expansion is not enough. We must attack the Court's legitimacy. Judicial review, or the idea that the Court decides the meaning of the Constitution, is a modern farce. It allows political leaders to avoid taking unpopular stances while letting the Court take the heat. 5/x"
10,"We need mass action by unions, civic groups, &amp; working people demanding what our women's liberation movement has historically fought for: abortion access, universal healthcare, free childcare, and worker control of profits. 4/x https://t.co/QvMHH22HZN"
11,"We have watched feminism turn into a tool for getting seats in corporate boardrooms of companies that continue to exploit workers. Meanwhile, poor and working-class women, through legislation like the Hyde Amendment, have long had their access to basic abortion rights limited 3/x"
12,"We must follow in the footsteps of our sisters and brothers in Argentina, Colombia, Ireland, and Mexico and take this fight into the streets and into our own hands. 2/x https://t.co/484VlrPVlm"
13,"The Supreme Court decision is the result of decades of failing to codify Roe, while the opposition spent years organizing and winning power. Fiery speeches will not be enough this time. Fundraising for corporate politicians will not be enough. Voting blue will not be enough. 1/x https://t.co/MuwdAqe3PV"

15,"@kellywind @ryangrim @hayleycbbrown @jfeldman_epi You have to call it out as fraudulent, imo, &amp; reject anyone who tries to hijack the project away from the needs of poor/working people. This is a problem almost across the board, where people with means/wealth end up as spokespeople for their ""identity"" b/c no one else gets heard"

17,"@kellywind @ryangrim @hayleycbbrown @jfeldman_epi Letting the top echelons of society have their own version of ""feminism"" allows their version to dominate. What TF is describing shouldn't be allowed to call itself the same name as the feminism of the poor &amp; working class."
