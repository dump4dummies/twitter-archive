0,@MarkDavis If I was Liz Cheney I‚Äôd be picking exactly this to ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù me.  Who‚Äôs to say that isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs happening.  #swampactions
1,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis LOL!  You‚Äôre a ‚Äúclever‚Äù debater.  Turning the sins of yourself into an attack on your opponent.  You are the one who cares not for free speech.  Allowing for government protected (partially) censorship of only Conservative speech.
2,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Let it take a month.  And let there be more censoring.  Those are less problematic than the anti-Conservative censoring currently going on.  You won‚Äôt scare me into accepting tje current situation where Conservatives get censored but others do not.
3,"@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Now you switch back.  If they have that right to just censor what they wish, then they don‚Äôt deserve special protections.  You can‚Äôt have it both ways.  You get special government protection, then you have to be evenhanded."
4,"@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Then if Twitter is not to be held responsible for all tweets, then it cannot be picking and choosing which ones it will choose to censor.  That is leading to the anti-Conservative tyranny currently in play."
5,@EcuadorChavez @MarkDavis Clearly they‚Äôre ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for the words of some users. They‚Äôve no trouble censoring Conservatives (by labeling it hate speech). Your mic analogy is misleading. The better comparison is a newspaper. Who is definitely responsible for what is allows people to write on its pages.
6,@MarkDavis They are indeed free to do as they wish.  But do they deserve Section 230 protections and still do as they wish?  I say no to that question.
7,@bill_tejas @MarkDavis Truly free enterprise won‚Äôt allow any monopoly that people don‚Äôt want.
8,"@wil_da_beast630 Lincoln, Washington, Coolidge, Reagan, Jefferson.  In that order."
9,"@wil_da_beast630 That‚Äôs very true.  But remember the reason this point is being brought up is because Biden wants to raise the INCOME tax.  If he were talking about raising those other taxes, the discussion would be different."

29,Likely.  But it‚Äôs tough to get a lot of them to admit it.  That‚Äôs an awful lot of pride to ask them to swallow (especially in public).  Keep working on them though.  With love and patience. https://t.co/VwJB59Y0Jt
30,@mcamelyne I certainly don‚Äôt disagree with that.  My point wasn‚Äôt to accept merely a name change.  But to highlight how now they want to call it the ‚Äútemple of democracy‚Äù when they don‚Äôt treat it as one.  Similar to Christ telling the Pharisees they‚Äôd turned it into a ‚Äúden of thieves‚Äù.
31,"RT @laurenboebert: Government doesn‚Äôt have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem."
32,A temple?  Massie is correct that that certainly is the wrong word for the place.  It has very often been the world‚Äôs most expensive brothel.  Where the inhabitants are selling their wares to the highest bidder. https://t.co/vfflHFQ3jy

35,"@mcamelyne LA, SF, Portland, Seattle, Honolulu, Albuquerque, Chicago, Philadelphia, NYC, and New England control over 30 Senate seats.  A few more pickoffs elsewhere and the forgotten and cancelled people in fly-over country, you say you fight for, won‚Äôt ever be able to get anything done"
36,"@mcamelyne That‚Äôs not totally unreasonable.  But, at the same time, I‚Äôd hate to see things we want passed blocked by just 20 Democratically dominated states.  If they‚Äôre worth stopping, stand up and do a real filibuster."
37,@mcamelyne We‚Äôd still have the filibuster Michael.  Just the kind that was always intended.  Not the nonsense kind that allows 41 Senators to hold up 59 Senators on anything they want without hardly any effort at all.
38,"@seryfortexas In the mail.  Will look for it.  ‚ÄúSupport your leadership‚Äù seems like a tricky little politician‚Äôs phraseology to make me sound less important than you.  But I‚Äôm always happy to support a good idea, wherever it comes from.  Let‚Äôs debate!  #TX06"
39,"Always like to highlight when I can agree with the other political party.  The non-talking filibuster has always been ridiculous.  If leader McConnell wants to have a ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù Senate, let‚Äôs see it.Ôøº
