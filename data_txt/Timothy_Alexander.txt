11,"Another heartbreak, barely a week since Uvalde. This time in the city of Tulsa, where four people were murdered in a hospital. Hospitals are places for healing. Schools are places for learning. Neither should be places of terror. We must take action now."
12,"From my family to yours, we wish you a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day. https://t.co/B7FoIrxBpL"
13,"My heart breaks for these families, the Uvalde community, and our country. Another senseless shooting at another elementary school. We cannot continue to allow this to happen. Meaningful legislative action is needed now. Yes, we should all pray, then demand change."

18,"Now more than ever, during some of the most trying times of recent history, South Jersey needs a representative who will be loyal to the people and put their needs over a party or an ex-president.

22,"The sad truth about gun violence is that it doesn’t discriminate. Whether it’s a Democratic area like Buffalo NY, or a Republican stronghold like Orange County, CA, we are not safe. Thoughts &amp; prayers don’t do enough. We need to update our gun laws NOW!"
23,"The race-based hate some harbor for fellow Americans is tearing at the fabric of our country. Ten more lives were lost at the hands of evil yet we appear helpless to address this violence. Enough.

29,"Jeff van Drew isn’t just anti-Democracy; he is also anti-American. Being 1 of 57 Representatives who voted against providing more aid to Ukraine, Van Drew has once again shown his lack of loyalty to America &amp; Democracy - it’s to himself and the extremist wing of his party. https://t.co/ktT9l5yA08"
