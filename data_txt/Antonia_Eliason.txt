1,"@JodyLMoore2 2022 is a long way off, but likely not. I'd like to work on community organizing and help support grassroots candidates at the local level in particular. My work restrictions make it prohibitively difficult to run, especially when combined with family obligations. But who knows?"
2,"To the 85,000+ people who voted for me: thank you. To everyone who contributed to my campaign, who supported my ideas, and who believed in me: thank you. We will be putting together a podcast in the next couple of months about the campaign so stay tuned."

20,"The most blatant yet often overlooked form of voter suppression - felony disenfranchisement. More than 1 in 10 voting-age people in our state simply aren't allowed to vote at all. Among Black Mississippians, it's 1 in 6. This is completely unacceptable for a democracy. https://t.co/7oe6wOyHZe"

36,"How about both? We cannot wait while a Trump-packed Court strips away decades of progress of human rights. Court expansion is the best immediate solution, then we can follow up with (long) term limits to help prevent this same crisis in the future. https://t.co/jOMEHKSr1h"
37,"Just recorded a fantastic climate change panel with some of the most knowledgeable and passionate folks I've had the good fortune of talking to on this subject. We'll be posting it in the next few days, so stay tuned. I came out of this conversation hopeful."
38,"The climate change responses were shameful. To repeatedly defend fracking and to provide no solutions or alternatives was embarrassing. It's like no one recognizes the urgency of climate change, and no one will until the coastal regions are all underwater. https://t.co/f0hIHyo1oC"

45,"The pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on women, on whom the responsibilities of childcare most often fall. We have no paid leave and no infrastructure to help women deal with these obligations. As a country, we are failing our women.

53,Neither candidate understands the urgency of climate change. End fossil fuel subsidies.
54,End fossil fuel subsidies. This would be a huge step towards combating climate change.
55,@realDonaldTrump you want crystal clean water and air but you repeal EPA regulations. And you're focused on raking forests. Climate change is the greatest threat we've ever faced. Repealing laws won't do it. We need renewable energy. FOREST FIRES DON'T CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE!
56,This is not a debate. This is a disgrace.

59,"@realDonaldTrump you say that drug prices are coming down. It's going to go down, you say. Insulin is like water, you say. My constituents haven't experienced this. This is pure grandstanding. Instead, the price of COVID-19 drugs has increased."
60,"A reminder that while climate change isn't included as a topic for tonight's debate, it's the single greatest threat to ever face humankind. This is an existential threat that should be at the center of discussion. Doing nothing isn't a solution. It won't go away if we ignore it."
61,"The very wealthy and large corporations in America pay far too little in taxes. When normal folks pay a lot more in federal taxes each year than people like Donald Trump, it's time to revisit the system and make sure that those who can least afford it don't bear all the burden."
