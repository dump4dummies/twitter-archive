1,Nancy Pelosi should be locked up for assaulting Mayra Flores child.
2,RT @RealOmarNavarro: I‚Äôm a Hispanic Republican running for Congress against Maxine Waters in now a majority 54 percent Hispanic District.
3,Maxine Waters is not happy that more Black voters will be born. Why?
4,@greg_price11 I‚Äôm not stealing money from anyone. People have a free choice to give to whatever candidates they want. Im not making them. You are playing victim card right now which is unfortunate. Every district should have someone challenging the incumbent. More infighting instead of action.
5,@greg_price11 Instead of attacking someone who lives in a highly democrat district you should be thanking me for aleast trying and being consistent. Mayra Flores won a largely democrat district which was Hispanic like mine. I have something you can‚Äôt and I can speak to the Hispanic community.
6,@ibookery @Qsmom2 Exactly buddy. Guns don‚Äôt kill people. People who are nuts kill people and Guns are used to protect life.
7,@AnnaNavarro My apologies. Corrected the tag.

60,@LynwoodTalks When you say living in California from 25k it tells me you are out of touch with state economics.
61,@LynwoodTalks I haven‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt know how you got that source information from? Because I paid myself 25k during election year in reimbursements. Also you know California living standards are much more expensive than other states. Rent in California in 3k for 1 bedroom. Not enough to live from.
62,@Ron4California Yes I am back. Should be an example to everyone not to give up regardless of life situations. God bless

82,@LacyLove2020 @ElrealMartinG Well I live in Los Angeles. Criminals don‚Äôt go to gun shops to get guns. They go to streets illegally and much cheaper. Check your white privilege when talking to a Hispanic.
83,@KevinKileyCA @glenwalkerktla What‚Äôs your stance on gun control? I know you are for abortion and believe in global warming.
84,Justin Trudeau is doing what his legitimate father Fidel Castro did in Cuba to my parents home country Cuba. He took away the guns so the government can control you and take away your freedom.
85,When the Democrats say they feel the pain for the children. It‚Äôs just fake and phony of them when they vote for abortion which is basically murder.
86,Joe Biden it wasn‚Äôt the gun lobby that killed those children nor law a abiding gun owner. Criminals break laws to get weapons illegally in the streets.

96,The world needs less of Bill Gates and more of Elon Musk! Who Agrees?
97,@TaraBull808 Yes
98,Bill Gates warns terrorists will try and use smallpox as a biological weapon as he bids for billions in funding to prevent future pandemics. Seems like #BillGates is working with terrorist to kill Americans.
99,"@snarkopolous @Kathy4Truth That‚Äôs the issue Oz and McCormick are rinos. Oz pushes the vaccine and mask and other guy worked with Bush a neocon. The issue you don‚Äôt like me is because I am not a neocon. I‚Äôm with Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebart. Many California Republicans are neocons."
