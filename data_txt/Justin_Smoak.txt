5,"@kylegriffin1 Will they be helping them get government issued ID’s as well? That would not only help with voting but also regular everyday things like renting cars, checking into hotels, flying on airplanes, etc…"
6,@LorenCulp Idiots like you help keep the Democrats in power in our state.
7,@GovInslee What science supports this decision? What evidence is there of spread at outdoor events?
8,@nickcivetta @ThePatClifton Beat me to it!!!
9,@RepDelBene My governor is an idiot.
10,@TheCenterStripe @LLinWood Yup
11,@LLinWood It’s you. You’re the traitor. If half the people who stayed home based on your bullshit protest nonsense had just voted the left would not have won the senate.
12,The 200k November Perdue voters that stayed home today sure proved a point. Thanks for being stupid. We get what you deserve.

46,"@jasonrantz Don’t forget that anytime actual voters challenged him at campaign events, he attacked them too. “You’re full of shit... I don’t work for you... let’s do some push ups, fatty” type stuff. Would have been interesting to see if any reporters actually challenged him."
47,"@maggmountains Presidential Book of Secrets, one tweet at a time!"

51,@jmartNYT @reidepstein Booting the Green Party off the ballot in WI sure helped too.

55,@catturd2 @maggmountains @gatewaypundit This is from The NY Times live feed yesterday. Something doesn’t jive. https://t.co/8cmNfYUhbW
56,Dems keeping Green Party off of ballot in Wisconsin paid off greatly for them but is a pretty shitty look for the self proclaimed “saving democracy” crowd. But that’s just independent/third party candidate saltiness on my part that ranked choice voting could easily fix.
57,@Chrisvance123 Sucks to suck Chris. At least you and the rest of your @ProjectLincoln com artists made some money for yourselves

60,@war_on_morons @AndrewYang Seems a bit dramatic. Just trying to get ahead of y’all calling me an idiot Trump supporting rube.
61,@idiot_robots @AndrewYang Shattered the 1st congressional district record for votes as an independent candidate and best social media engagement metrics for all candidates (including Dems and Repubs) so I’d say it did ok.
62,"@Optimistbot @AndrewYang No shit, guy. Point is that being almost back to where you were when the entire global economy ground to a halt after only 3 months is probably still good news, but let’s still be salty about it because it’s not fully recovered."
63,"@AndrewYang Sour grapes, man. As a center right moderate with a masters degree in engineering, I fell for your “not left not right but forward” schtick. Tweets like this showing your true colors?"
64,"@HCSJuicey Since most of the people who died are of social security age, your tax paying argument doesn’t quite hold up..."
65,"Well it was a record number of votes for an independent in the 1st district (and second most of any independent statewide) so I’m pretty ok with it. If you think inslee takes this seriously, explain how his science and data changes once people start rejecting him? https://t.co/XU1qJOhElr"
66,"@HumanityForward You should tag @SpeakerPelosi in this. She’s the one holding it up. Not left not right but forward, right?"
67,@CoryBooker Because the first working mom to be a Supreme Court justice is a terrible thing. Check your privilege @CoryBooker
68,"@HumanityForward And for that matter, tell the clowns like @GovInslee to open up the economy. Most people would rather earn their money than get unfunded handouts."
69,@HumanityForward Take it up with Nancy. She’s the one holding up payments to citizens for the benefit of the progressive wish list.

75,@GovInslee Culp!
76,"@jasonrantz Wtf does a Supreme Court justice need to believe or not believe about climate change? Real or not, whatever laws are passed to address it need to be constitutional and the judges determine that. Have Democrats abandoned the legislative process?"
77,"@SenWarren @AOC They can’t “steal another” seat, they can only steal one at most. Either what they did 4 years ago (which you support now) was wrong, or what they’re doing now (which you supported 4 years ago) is wrong, but it can’t be both."

97,"@BrandiKruse I’d say the base is more moderate, the party bosses are just incapable of getting anyone in line. Twice as many non Inslee voters voted against Culp than voted for him. And the GOP won’t even have a candidate for Lt Gov. everyone in charge of the @WAGOP should be fired."
98,The @WAGOP might not even get a candidate on the Lt governor Nov ballot and couldn’t prevent their voters from supporting either a prankster or an actual special needs candidate for insurance commissioner. Burn it down. Burn it all down.
