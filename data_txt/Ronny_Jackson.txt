36,American families are being CRUSHED at the gas pump and Biden’s “solution” is to tell working families to buy an expensive electric car. I’m sick of this green nonsense. These people are HEARTLESS!
37,Biden WANTS the border crisis to get worse - there’s no other explanation. Every month is a bigger disaster. We need a return to the TRUMP policies NOW!
38,The details in this article are absolutely horrific. Banging on drums late into the night. Protestors telling Kavanaugh’s neighbors “f*** your children.” Why is this allowed to continue? The DOJ must act IMMEDIATELY to STOP these illegal protests! https://t.co/cvy6aDByx0
39,Pro-Abortion TERROR group “Jane’s Revenge” called firebombing pregnancy centers “easy &amp; fun.” These people are SICK! Has the DOJ opened up a counter-terror investigation like they did with concerned parents at school board meetings? This type of violence is what Democrats WANT!

45,HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the BEST President of my lifetime!! We need President Trump BACK in the White House!

59,What’s the WORST thing about Biden?

68,"Nancy Pelosi gave Liz Cheney a personal security detail, but DENIED extra protections for our Supreme Court justices. Our justices are facing DIRECT THREATS, yet Pelosi is more concerned with protecting her favorite “Republican” puppet. She WANTS our justices to be in DANGER!!"
69,"Tonight I will vote AGAINST Pelosi’s latest attempt to ERASE our 2nd Amendment. Democrats will do anything to criminalize law-abiding gun owners, and I’ll do EVERYTHING to STOP them!!"
70,"Remember when Jen Psaki PRAISED the protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices? She referred to the violent threats as, “a lot of passion.” Deep down, this White House wants MORE threats against the justices they disagree with. NOTHING is sacred to them!!"
71,"First, Democrats made LITERAL calls to arms against Pro-Lifers. 

Then, Pro-Life pregnancy centers were FIREBOMBED. 

Now, a potentially deranged man with a knife and gun was arrested outside Kavanaugh’s home. 

The Democrat attacks on life are DESPICABLE!!"

76,"The Cheney/Pelosi WITCH HUNT committee is a DISGRACE. They want to do EVERYTHING to silence President Trump &amp; his supporters, and their ""primetime hearings"" are reminiscent of Soviet show-trials. We have MUCH more important things we should be doing!!"
77,"Truly a MIRACLE that Jakin Mashburn is here today. God's plan for Jakin didn't end the night he collapsed. THANK YOU to the Amarillo's first responders whose heroic efforts helped save Jakin's life. TRUE HEROS!

83,We need President Trump BACK in the White House!!
84,"The Biden Administration is requiring all schools to abide by its RADICAL LGBT policies, and if they don’t, the funding for reduced lunches for low-income students is CANCELED. This White House puts NOTHING ahead of their woke agenda, including letting kids go hungry."

88,"Janet Yellen should resign as Treasury Secretary. Her body of work speaks for itself. She was DEAD WRONG on inflation, and now you’re suffering because of it. Yellen has been a total FAILURE."
89,I’m SICK of this White House saying their “top priority” is fixing inflation. This is a LIE. They’ve done NOTHING to drive prices down. VOTE REPUBLICAN for lower prices on EVERYTHING!
90,"The City Council members who approved this plan have eroded their trust with the voters, and I hope that EVERY member who voted ""yes"" on this proposal is held accountable next time they're up for re-election."
91,"The City Council didn't allow multiple readings of the proposal. They rushed this spending through, and now you're going to be stuck with 30% HIGHER property taxes. 

What they're doing is WRONG, and it will now take legal action to clean up this mess."

95,"Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rouke will NEVER be governor. First he said he wants to seize firearms from law abiding citizens. Then he’s against it. Now he’s for it. Flip flop?? Dems will say &amp; do ANYTHING to get elected, and once in office, they won’t stop until your rights are GONE."
96,"The story about how Biden is ""furious"" that his staffers continue to ""correct"" him confirms everything we already knew: Biden isn't the one calling the shots. The fact is Biden isn't capable of running the country, and this White House is doing EVERYTHING to cover it up!"
97,This weekend Biden said he wants to BAN 9mm ammo. This would BAN the most commonly used firearms across the country. Democrats aren't sincere when they talk about public safety. Their main goal is ERASING your 2nd Amendment Rights. They're RADICAL!

99,"Like most on the Radical Left, he’ll say or do anything to hurt President Trump, and hurt his STRONGEST defenders in Congress. What Dr. Reiner is saying is a provable LIE - I hope a correction is made!"
