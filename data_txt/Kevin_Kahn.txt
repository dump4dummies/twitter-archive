0,"@theangrytacoz @SenatorHassan However, the discussions and decisions one makes regarding their own health and that of their children, hopefully in consultation with a trusted medical provider, are. The outcome of those decisions may indeed affect how one is able to interact with the rest of society."
1,@theangrytacoz @SenatorHassan Being belligerently anything is most likely a road that would lead one to infringe on other’s rights. Personal medical decisions should remain personal.
2,"@theangrytacoz @SenatorHassan Agreed. And as stated a couple of times in the discussion, an individual’s rights do not include infringing the rights of other individuals."
3,"@theangrytacoz @SenatorHassan Either the government gets to have a say in your bodily autonomy or it doesn't. It can give recommendations to individuals and groups on how to best avoid spreading communicable diseases, but it can't force you to undergo a medical procedure."
4,"After a discussion this evening about @SenatorHassan stances on medical freedom, worth a revisit. https://t.co/cBgvvhjReB"
5,"@iheartauthority @NHpilled @LeslieD38009274 I would call myself ""Free State adjacent"".  I didn't move here with the FSP, but to be closer to family. But I chose NH because of the independent mindset and support of individual rights.  I try to support Free Stater owned businesses as much as possible."
6,@LeslieD38009274 @NHpilled I read a Tweet from the FSP spokeperson who said that Free Staters now account for 1% of the NH population.  It's got to be more than just Free Staters that believe that infringement of the 2A is infringement on individual rights
7,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I will be here to provide your entertainment. Let's set the date of the debate!
8,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Since I used the term ""contract"" (not contacts, right) in my Tweet, I'm fairly sure I would."
9,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I'm not against unvaccinate.  I'm against force vaccination. Every individual has the right to bodily autonomy.

Slavery...because you implied that unvaccinated maids were the only ones that would be available. It's sad that you don't think vaccinated nurses would volunteer."
10,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I'd relish the opportunity.  Please ask her to invite me.
11,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Generally, in every state in this union, the owners of the businesses get to set the terms of the contract for the services they are willing to provide.  We aren't in the Soviet Union."
12,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Another of your direct quotes from 3 minutes ago

""to be attended to by..unvaccinated maids?"""
13,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Are you one of those folks that don't have medical insurance under which a corporation is making decisions on what procedures they will cover based on the level of premiums you pay?
14,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan What healthcare decisions are corporations making? What healthcare decisions are they already making by operating an elderly care facility outside of the COVID issue?
15,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I'm sure they also appreciate your use of stating that it would certainly be that group that attended to folks that went to the facilities.
16,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I'm not against them returning to their residences. I'm against the government forcing them back in if the administrators believe it would be hazardous to the other residents and would want to make alternative arrangements. Slavery - are unvaccinated maids being forced to work?
17,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Our government was using federal funds to pay people not to work. The money they paid to the nursing home would have been transferred to the facility that was actually housing them, and, people servicing them would have been cognizant of the situation. We have outlawed slavery."
18,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan You may want to revisit that time period to recognize that people who weren’t even diagnosed as having COVID were locked down and suspended from earning a living hampering their ability to put food on the table for their families.
19,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Lots can be proffered in hindsight. If you go back through my social media to that time, you’ll find that I encouraged local hotel/motel owners that were suffering from lockdowns to reach out to these facilities to see if they could be quarantine residences for the COVID positive"
20,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan So avoid the multiple sources I posted and demand an answer and you accuse me of trolling ???
21,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I just referred back to The NY Times article while you ignore the several other articles that are Fox News? Who’s really trolling here?
22,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan So you didn’t read AP or Newsweek which I posted? I could also give you NY Post and others as well.

And even The NY Times mentioned falsifying records. Records are falsified because everything was kosher?"
23,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan My answer is that I disagree with you and that an organization that will hide behind Qualified Immunity and/or Sovereign Immunity shouldn’t usurp the rights of private organizations to implement policies that they best see fit for their organization.
24,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I’ve posted multiple articles that said recovering. So your position is the administrations of the elederly care facilities get their policies usurped and dictated by state level government?
25,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I’m still waiting for your answer, do you agree with the several governors that required elderly care facilities to readmit patients that were diagnosed  with COVID under penalty of government intervention?"
26,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan A right doesn’t include using force, fraud or coercion that infringes on any other individual’s rights."
27,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan No. I’m challenging your statement.

You, yourself just wrote individual rights aren’t absolute"
28,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan So you don’t believe in inherent rights? Just by the nature of being human, there are no rights associated? Anything you do must be granted by someone else?"
29,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan My stance hasn’t changed???

Other than the individual who has rights that the government needs to be restricted from infringing?"
30,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan ""Recovering""

The point is this is a potential outcome when the government dictates health choices in lieu of giving the best information available, and letting patients and doctors decide what is best.

31,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan Is the NY Times the news outlet of ""my party""?  Were they misrepresenting the situation?

Do I need to provide you more news outlet citations?

https://t.co/cPqSNpqUVI"
32,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I'm not good with anyone ""knowingly infecting"" anyone else. An individual's rights end when they infringe on another individual. You good with certain governors knowingly putting COVID infected elderly residents back in group home among the most vulnerable population?"
33,@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan It's not a non-answer. Bodily autonomy is a principle and an inherent right. You don't get to dictate what other people must do to their bodies based on your own beliefs and convenience. It's that simple.
34,"@BrianHelman @Maggie_Hassan I think it is up to the parents in private consultation with their personal medical provider to decide what is best for their family. And, I think they should be able to choose an available educational environment that fits that decision."

36,"@Maggie_Hassan Not necessarily. I would vote to keep the government out of all personal medical decisions between a patient and their medical provider, not only on pregnancy issues, but also against threatening people's livelihoods and home / food security for not wanting to take a vaccine."
