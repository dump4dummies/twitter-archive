1,"An eye-opening read here from @JordanUhl about the death and financial destruction inflicted by Big Pharma while our government stands by. It's criminal.

2,"Our politicians are selling out millions of Americans to a dangerous drug cartel. Its members: Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi. https://t.co/pcNwI36sk3"
3,"Abortion got outlawed in Missouri just minutes after Roe was struck down. For working-class people who can't get the care they need, this isn't an election issue — it's a right now issue.

Just ""go vote"" isn't good enough for survivors of rape and incest. Congress must act."

8,Big thanks to dozens of volunteers who powered through the storm with us. The movement we’re building will always stand with LGBTQ+ Missourians.

11,"The filibuster doesn't come up much for Wall Street bailouts, Big Oil subsidies, or overseas wars and nation building... But it somehow always comes up for abortion, voting rights, collective bargaining, insulin prices, and even investments in job creation here at home.

Weird."

14,"It's not about abortion to Josh Hawley — it's all about power and control.

The power to undermine our freedoms and keep us divided, all so elites like him can control our democracy, our economy, and even our bodies. https://t.co/AHS1zHHgsf"
15,"15 years ago, I joined the Marines to serve my community. When they sent us out to fight and die overseas, they told us we were defending freedom. But at home, they were undermining our freedoms to keep us divided.

20,"A lot of DC Democrats are saying this is now an ""election"" issue. That is BULLSHIT.

Abortion was outlawed TODAY in Missouri.

Missourians can't just wait for another election. Senate Democrats need to end the filibuster and codify Roe NOW."
21,"If you’re a U.S. Senator who supports the filibuster, then you support keeping abortion illegal in Missouri."
22,"We all know who this decision will fall hardest on — working people and struggling families. They're losing control over their bodies and their economic opportunities. We need to take our power back.

In the Senate, I will fight like hell to guarantee access to abortion for all."
23,"This is a Big Brother attack on all of us. Congress must immediately end the filibuster and codify Roe v. Wade. If they won't, then we must replace them."
24,"As of this moment, abortion is no longer legal in the state of Missouri, even in cases of rape or incest. https://t.co/cRbxa3kMDQ"
