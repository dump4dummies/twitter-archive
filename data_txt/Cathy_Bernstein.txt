1,"@NYCMayor @CelebrateIsrael With all due respect, I took the subway Friday at 6 PM on the one train from 14th St. to West 72nd St. Not once was there a police officer on the platform or in a subway car. Please put them in the subway cars!"
2,@Staboogie0311 @MyraRuizNews @foxcarolinanews Same thought!
3,@InspireMeyer @UWBadgers Thank you for sharing. I lost my brother cancer when we were young and my family never recovered. Losing a loved one is beyond difficult and I know that many young people suffer from depression.

39,"@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund Every policy is set up to protect the criminals and not victims. Are the politicians of NYC trying to get ordinary folks to just give up and leave their home, so it can be taken back because of gentrification? Many folks I know are leaving and that’s what I’m hearing from them."
40,@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund Where is the compassion for the victims? Why do we only consider the feelings of the criminals?  Per many women being threatened with a knife it’s not something they can just get over lightly and yet they still show up at work because they need the job.
41,@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund 4) Please understand that some people need their jobs to pay their rent and buy food for their family. And so they go place themselves in a store and it’s quite frightening for them. I’ve spoken to many women at the stores and they are scared to death every single day.
42,"@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund 3) For some reason, the mentally ill and criminals, don’t threaten large, 6 foot five, 250 pound, 25 year old men. They are going after the women and the older employees at the stores. Would you want to come to work if every day you were threatened?"
43,"@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund 2) Local stores and big chain stores are giving up. Their employees have been severely traumatized by mentally ill and criminals that have threaten them with sharp cutting objects, large knives, and open brutality, their fists, and are afraid now to come to work"
44,@NYCMayor @iamcardib @NYCMayorsFund 1) Appreciate you trying to help the victims of the fire. Can you also please help the victims of crime on the UWS….  We have a very large homeless population here that takes X large duffel bags and fills them up with every item from our local stores.
45,@NYCMayor @ydanis @NYC_DOT @NYPDnews @NYPDPC Why are women and the elderly allowed to be repeatedly assaulted and there is no bail. Do you want the women and elderly to leave Manhattan? Is it FAIR that many elderly women on the UWS are afraid to go shop for groceries? https://t.co/XKaDzhbW4d
46,"@NYCMayor @ydanis @NYC_DOT @NYPDnews @NYPDPC The young homeless man who assaulted these two elderly women was in his mid-20s. He had already been released, NO BAIL, for stomping on a man’s head. Then, he went on to viciously assault two elderly women on the sidewalk on W. 79th St. and W. 80th St. https://t.co/XKaDzhbW4d"
47,"@NYCMayor @ydanis @NYC_DOT @NYPDnews @NYPDPC You were talking about the street, I am talking about the sidewalk.

52,"@NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor Just FYI - I took the subway this morning, the # 1 line and had the pleasure of being in a Subway car, yes I got off at the next stop, with a homeless man who decided to publicly masturbate. Again, do the taxpayers have any rights?"
53,"@NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor This was 9:30 in the morning. W. 79th St. Shouldn’t it be safe for the elderly to walk at 9:30 in the morning? Why should someone who so viciously assaulted two elderly women, and he’s in his 20s, be allowed out without any bail?"
54,@NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor This man stomped on another man’s head and was released without bail. He then went on too viciously attacked two elderly women ( they both had to go to the hospital and one has facial disfigurement) and he was released without bail again
55,@NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor https://t.co/XKaDzhbW4d
56,@NYCMayor Please end the new bail laws.
57,"@ManhattanDA 1/3 I asked this with all respect, but do victims have rights?  There was a very violent attack on W. 79th St. and. W. 80th. A homeless man severely beat up 2 women and sent them both to the hospital.  One woman’s face was permanently disfigured."

60,@ManhattanDA 3/3 - Why is violence against women and the elderly allowed in 2021 and 2022 in NYC? Do you have any compassion or empathy for a woman whose face was permanently disfigured by a man who should’ve been in jail for stomping on a man’s head?
61,"@ManhattanDA 2/3 this man had been released without any bell prior to this incident for stomping on a man’s head. Yes, that’s right, stomping on a man’s head. There was no bail. And so what happen next? He violently attacked these two women, older women."
62,"@devin_ @NYCMayor @GovKathyHochul Maybe if there had been a cop on the corner that day, two elderly women would not have gone to the hospital. One of them is permanently disfigured. How about some sympathy for the victims of crimes. How about some sympathy for the woman who died today."

65,"@NYCMayor In this attack, two women were sent to the hospital and one was permanently disfigured. Yet, he was released without bail again! Why is violence acceptable against women? Why does the DA care more about the criminal than the victims who had to go to the hospital!"
66,"@NYCMayor Two elderly women were brutally beaten on W. 79th St. / Broadway within minutes on a Thursday morning at 9:20 AM. The suspect, Darrell Johnson, age 28, arrested 15 times prior. Prior attack-  stomped on a man’s head, but was released without bail."

Many folks can’t afford to take an Uber to go to the doctors office or get to work and so they are daily harassed by mentally ill people on the subways. Where is the compassion for tax paying citizens?"
71,"@unkwn_123 @mirandadevine Carl, With all due respect, please look at the story at West 79th and Broadway. A homeless man attacked two women. Why didn’t he go after men, because they probably would’ve hit him back. It’s easy when you attack elderly women"

73,@NYCTSubway Why… why is there no thought for the workers in NYC who have to take the subway to work???
74,@JCAndersonNYC @UWSGMA326 I guess the men who died at the Lucerne of drug overdoses don’t deserve to be mentioned?  This hotel offered zero oversight and there was constant and rampant drug use on the premises. Very sad that these men died. It could have been prevented.

78,@ericadamsfornyc Two older women were viciously attacked Thursday morning at 9 AM on W. 79th St. and Broadway. They both are in serious condition and are in the hospital after being assaulted
79,"@ericadamsfornyc The man then fled northbound to 80th and Broadway, where at 9:22 a.m., he allegedly hit another woman in the face, police said. She was also transported to Mount Sinai; her age was not yet available, police said."
80,"@ericadamsfornyc At 9:20 a.m., the man allegedly came up from behind a 50-year-old woman walking her dog near the northwest corner of the intersection, before slamming his arms into her and punching her in the face, police said. She was transported to Mount Sinai Morningside [St. Lukes]"
81,"@ericadamsfornyc On Thursday morning, 9 AM, on W. 79th St. and Broadway, a 28-year-old homeless man violently attacked two older women. Both of them are in the hospital. Long history of assaults. He was already released and is back at the NW corner today of 79th and Broadway."

83,@MitchKSmith Disappointed about your journalistic integrity in not reporting the facts. He committed #domesticviolence. The woman that he ran over w/ his car was the mother of his child. She was trying to escape bc he punched her in the face w/a closed fist. Do women not count in your story?
84,@RilliTho She doesn’t walk on the streets or take a subway!
85,"@andylocal @NYCMayor We also had multiple Level 3 sex offenders at the Hotel Belleclaire, some had raped children as young as age 4 and five, boys and girls. Why not write about why they were dropped off in a hotel that was within 1000 feet from two playgrounds and three schools?"
86,@andylocal @NYCMayor Homeless at the Belleclaire did not choose to get vaccinated although they were the first ones offered the vaccine. They also refused to wear a mask endangering our elderly. Not sure why you can’t bother to write about that??
87,"@andylocal @LegalAidNYC Andy in your due diligence as you write your next story - can you cover the fact that the homeless in the hotels refuse to get vaccinated and refuse to wear a mask.  Will you inquire about the concerns of the elderly on the UWS, we have a very large population here of seniors."
88,@LegalAidNYC @JennerBlockLLP @NYHomeless @SafetyNetUJC @CID_NY Do the children in my UWS neighborhood have any rights? The children under the age of 12 cannot be vaccinated per the federal government. They depend upon everyone else to be vaccinated to safeguard their health. Do they have any rights to their own health?
89,"@LegalAidNYC @JennerBlockLLP @NYHomeless @SafetyNetUJC @CID_NY Do the elderly that live in my neighborhood have any rights? Do they have a right to live in a healthy environment?   They are aggressively panhandle by men who will not take the vaccine and refuse to wear a mask. Again, do they have any rights as tax paying citizens?"
90,"@LegalAidNYC @JennerBlockLLP @NYHomeless @SafetyNetUJC @CID_NY The homeless in hotels refuse to take the vaccine bc they claim they have a medical condition. 

They are now claiming they can’t go back to the shelters bc they have not been vaccinated.

Where I live, they REFUSE to wear a mask"
91,"@andylocal @LegalAidNYC Folks that I know that have degenerative diseases ( wheel chair) from Parkinson’s and ALS, cancer, mental illness ( bipolar) have successfully received the vaccine.
They care about themselves &amp; their community.  I have zero tolerance for anyone who does not receive the vaccine."
92,@andylocal @LegalAidNYC The unofficial vaccine rate of the homeless in the hotels is now at 16%. It’s not a state secret.
