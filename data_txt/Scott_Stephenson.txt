12,"@juliecbarrett Totally agree.

This is why I don’t say I’m “pro-life”—I am anti-abortion.

Stand up or get the hell out of our way. We have a country to save."
26,". @Aaronlewismusic was amazing and inspiring tonight. He finished the show with characteristically bold words about the destruction of our country, then asked us all “What the eff are you going to do about it?” So, what are you? https://t.co/WxFcmDgLp9"

I am so grateful that #SCOTUS refused to be intimidated by the street Commies unleashed on them.

The idea that we can only win by running to the middle (and actively ignoring the needs of our base) is a PROVEN losing strategy.

50,They’re fully aware of the destruction of our country by the Radical Left and RINO right. They both taught school for decades and are disgusted with the woke indoctrination. They worry for America. And they have the perspective to know that this is all deliberate. They said so.
51,"Amazing meeting with Les and Lorraine, big Trump supporters like me. They’ve been married 72 years with their anniversary on July 4.

67,@SZBishop77 @BrandiKruse @choeshow What is “extreme right wing?”  Specifics please.  Not that I mind the moniker…
68,@KIRO7Seattle Why is “shall not be infringed” hard for WA law makers to understand? This violates the 2nd amendment and must be struck down. I would vote against anything like this. I will never give even 1 inch.
69,"@BrandiKruse @choeshow Genuinely happy that you found your niche. Seems like a pretty good gig.

Campaign is going great. Turns out people outside of Seattle actually have very strong opinions on all the issues. Who would have known?🤷🏻‍♂️"
70,"@BrandiKruse @choeshow Arguably? Way to take a real stand, Brandi. 

I save my outrage for people who don’t make their living straddling the fence. At least they are brave enough to pick a side and fight rather than trying to drum up controversy without actually having to do anything controversial."

79,I’ve learned there are key places to place campaign signs. Meeting the folks who own the properties is a fun sleuthing operation. The resulting conversations and questions are invaluable. This is a tough but rewarding process.

97,"@coachktemp @PedersenJenny7 You want to shut down a discussion of something that half this country doesn’t agree with you about. 

Illegal ballot harvesting and trafficking. Changing laws in violation of the Constitution. 100% voter turnout. Those are reality. Why can’t we even discuss them?"
98,@coachktemp @PedersenJenny7 I feel likewise about your position. But this type of disagreement is where healthy debates start. And that’s the essence of our Republic.
