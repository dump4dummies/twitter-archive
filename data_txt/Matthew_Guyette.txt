38,1) Who can constrain this president?   Not Congress: they subpoenaed his employees and documents and he defied them.   What enforcement mechanism do they have when Trump controls the Justice Department and federal law enforcement?
39,"2) Not the Senate: they have revealed themselves to be entirely under his control.   Maybe the Judiciary, packed with Trump appointees and bereft, like Congress, of any mechanism to enforce its edicts?"
40,"3) Can the voters, if he controls the propaganda they consume and maybe even the elections themselves?    Perhaps Fox News is the only institution which he fears.   But they will not turn against their greatest creation."
