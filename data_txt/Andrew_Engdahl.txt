41,"@kishineff @RepThompson I am for peace and diplomacy, but I am for a just peace that the Ukrainians choose for, with Putin and his army leaving their lands. The “peace” you seem to champion is the fall of the sovereign state of Ukraine and the defeat of its people by Putin and his forces."
42,"@kishineff @RepThompson You are the one who has been propagandized, as it appears that you trust Russian sources (literally Putin’s state-run propoganda machine) more than our decentralized media. You are out of touch with how most of the rest of the world sees this conflict."
43,"@kishineff @RepThompson The Azov Battalion is but a fraction of the Ukrainian military, yet your insinuations would lump the whole Ukrainian resistance as a “Nazi regime,” which is not only wrong but also grossly insensitive Ukrainians. Equivocate all you want, you are still apologizing for Putin"
44,"@kishineff @RepThompson So they should just give up? Simply allow Putin to destroy their homes, overthrow their government, kill their leaders and those who resist, and control the rest? I am for peace and diplomacy, but Putin is not and that is the difference. How can you not see that?"

51,"@kishineff @RepThompson Speak for yourself Jason, I care about people and believe it is in everyone’s best interest that the Ukrainians succeed. We have made many foreign policy mistakes in the past, but I do not believe that supporting Ukraine in it’s fight to defend their homeland to be one of them."
