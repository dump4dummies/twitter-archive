1,Is this seriously an article written all about the “dire need” of new glassware at the White House? Give me a break as if the country doesn’t have many more pressing issues. Wtf! 🤦🏼‍♂️ @CNN @KateBennett_DC https://t.co/PbPZpuPO1n
2,Do not trust @Valvoline to do your oil changes. They will ruin your vehicle and not take responsibility for it. Spread the word and beware. #Avoid #Valvoline #ValvolineInstantOilChange #Consequences
3,@HiltonHotels Since when is allowing a Doordash driver to deliver food to a room security issue?? They are delivering food! I genuinely want to know.
4,"@Logic_Shock @TwcArthur @MSNBC @NBCNews Here you go. Watch the trial, not listen to the media narrative and you’ll find more facts. https://t.co/YGEgsOBZO3"
5,@TwcArthur @MSNBC @NBCNews If the judge is guilty of anything it’s trying to appease everyone and ensure a fair trial. He’s gone out of his way to even explain his rulings to the twisting media. Fact check me 😉
6,I’m pretty sure attempted jury tampering/stalking is a felony @MSNBC. 👀😙 @NBCNews    https://t.co/oXuYCzitqM #RittenhouseVerdict #RittenhouseTrial
7,"Fake news reports again, saying Trump endorsed McAuliffe and saying the race hadn’t been called yet when Trump sent out his email. But that’s not true, the race was called by Newsmax moments before Trump emailed. #fakenews @mychaelschnell @FoxNews @thehill https://t.co/uFFgK24zPx"

9,"What does this article mean by “overwhelmingly women who birth children”... got some news for you, only women can birth children. Someone please explain? @guardian @JillFilipovic https://t.co/G4Z0hhsDmk"
10,"@Plantingideas1 @Dempz8 I agree 100%. The same for the vaccine, Correlation is not equal to causation. We don’t know if the vaccine is helping or not."

13,"@DerekWalder @Dempz8 Which ones are dangerous? You said productS, as in plural so I’m curious which vitamin you find dangerous?"
14,"@murder_turd @benshapiro You are a sick person. What entitlement are you talking about??? A right to life!!!?? It takes 2 consenting sexual partners to make a baby. Old enough to have sex, old enough to at least let a child be born. #responsibility"
15,Well I have no words except.... exactly! https://t.co/6EyeJEAd78
16,"@DennisExMachina @kayleighmcenany Incorrect. I am both vaccinated and I wear a mask. Not to make myself feel better, but for the benefit of others. I am simply making a statement about how misguiding this Administration has been. Case-in-point; Masks mandates vs no mask and the 🦠"
17,"RT @benshapiro: Priorities of our military leadership:
✓ Diversity
✓ Revising restrictions on trans troops
✓ Lecturing Tucker Carlson

18,"@DennisExMachina @kayleighmcenany “Let’s circle back”.... but in other news, picture it “Vaccinated persons no longer need masks let’s celebrate”... 5 mins later... “Just kidding put those masks on.” Need I say more? 😅"
19,@NumbersMean @dhourigan @brithume Remember when unemployment was the lowest ever under Trump for all races? Remember how terrorists were almost a non-existent threat to the USA during Trumps 4 years? Remember peace in the Middle East? I’ll wait 🤦🏼‍♂️
20,@DennisExMachina @kayleighmcenany I’m pretty sure this is the dumbest comment I’ve read today. Kayleigh was always much more prepared than old Psaki. “Circle back” comes to mind. Get outta here. 🤦🏼‍♂️
21,"@18DianneM @HilbillyLiberal @ArielGaeta @daSlackAttack @RealCandaceO And thanks for your courteousness, calling someone you don’t know an “idiot”. I expect more from people but alas when will I learn."
22,@18DianneM @HilbillyLiberal @ArielGaeta @daSlackAttack @RealCandaceO Obviously they are not “paper” but for all intents and purposes they basically offer the same protection Unless you have an N95. Which most people do not
23,"@HilbillyLiberal @ArielGaeta @daSlackAttack @RealCandaceO N95 masks I believe do work. However most people do not wear N95 masks, but paper masks that do not stop viruses. Once again I will say I do use masks just for others to feel better. And I’m vaccinated. But everyone seems to get Covid especially those who use masks. We can’t deny"
24,@RealCandaceO I am not matter-of-factly against masks BUT what I can say is they are a false sense of security. They do not work and they never have worked at preventing disease and viruses. This is common sense and science. I do wear a mask but only to make others feel better.
25,"@HilbillyLiberal @ArielGaeta @daSlackAttack @RealCandaceO Although I am@mot against masks, I can easily say and point out many references that masks simply do not work. There is no scientific basis on which paper masks work. They don’t stop viruses. Stop spreading false info"
