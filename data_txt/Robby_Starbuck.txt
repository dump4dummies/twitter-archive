3,"@BourbonLover216 There’s a vouching alternative that I met with the most vouching letters ever. They denied the vouching letters. In my opinion, anyone who kicks republicans off the ballot and takes choices away from voters is a RINO. Real republicans let voters decide."

14,Tonight there’s a congressional debate in the district I’m running in but I’ve been disinvited from it because at least 2 of my opponents are cowards who refuse to show up if I’m allowed to debate.

17,"This is a real headline from @latimes. I thought the left was ""anti-racist"". You know, I don’t think enough people stop and consider that maybe a large part of the left is actually scared of black people and that’s why they support gun control and want abortion on demand.

23,@theonegeoffg Yep we have attachments we’re making for them
24,"On the upside for Democrats, if they just keep masking and social distancing then they won’t ever have to worry about getting pregnant. No reproduction, no abortions and they get to keep their COVID theater up — that’s a win/win!"

45,"We need to immediately begin law enforcement raids on the homes of those involved, make them wait a year to get a trial and put them in solitary confinement. That’s the standard Democrats set. Oh and we need a committee on TV produced by an Emmy winner to shame Democrats."

70,"Shocker, woke corporate America wants to pay for you to go get an abortion so you don’t take maternity leave or cost them $ when you give birth and add a baby to your healthplan. Dems may see this as brownie ESG points but it’s actually demonic, dehumanizing corporatism. https://t.co/sJMb5ldnyR"

86,@JustinTrudeau Justin you literally forced people to have a vaccine injected into their body when they didn’t want it so knock off the virtue signaling BS about politicians not telling people what to do with their body. Laws banning abortion are about what you can’t do to someone else’s body.
