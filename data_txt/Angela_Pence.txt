Also Republicans- We will get the gov. involved in literally everything we don't believe in and force everyone to live how we think they should. JESUS."
28,"@LibertyAngelo Eh, best they can do is ban them lolol"
29,"and I do NOT ever want to hear another Republican bitch about ""MEDICAL FREEDOM"". If you aren't for true medical freedom for everyone, even when you don't agree, then you are just another grifter. You don't believe in TRUE freedom."
30,"Well, there it is folks. If your eyes aren't open, especially as a woman, they are about to be. I don't agree w/ abortion. However, a woman's right to make decisions regarding her body should always be protected. I am not open for discussion on this. #GA14 #RoeVsWade https://t.co/I4uG7QCFpU"

35,@Graham4GA See ya in hell buddy.
36,"Ah, the gov. hard at work. In 2020, the gov. truly worked impressively hard to destroy small businesses. The ones that weren't destroyed are constantly dealing with red tape, harassment, etc.. to be ""compliant"". Leave our small businesses alone! #GA14 #thingsjesusneversaid https://t.co/TX5XGnN7jp"
37,@CoreyRForrester Yes.
38,"Oh look... it is just the gov. allowing the police to tread harder. This is absolutely going to affect all folks but guess who it is going to disproportionally affect? Who cares tho right? America, you're allowing your rights to be destroyed one by one. #Miranda https://t.co/f5uyUYGxe2"
39,"Honestly, the folks that made these are brilliant. LOL. Hatred for immigrants really is misplaced. Don't hate them. Hate our system. Our gov. has made it so difficult for immigrants to come here legally, they have to resort to drastic measures. #ImmigrationRefrom #GA14 https://t.co/IgHw4emF45"
40,"hehe. Obviously, I am on one today, but this is fantastic. It literally says in the bible to leave the judgement up to God. Yet, here our gov. is thinking that it's job is to pass judgement and dictate what is right and wrong. That's God's job. Not corrupt politician's job. #GA14 https://t.co/VtO6Efnxgb"

63,"Just a reminder. No one, not one single person walking on this Earth, is good enough to govern another human being without that person's permission. This includes our gov. and politicians.

70,"#AusticPrideDay. As a mother of an autistic son, we celebrate the unique traits that make him, him.

71,"Yesterday, Dan and I were talking about how GA was a great state to live in. It was reported a few days ago that GA hit a new all time low, with unemployment rates hitting 3.1%. This is absolutely great considering how unstable the national economy seems. #GAPOL #GA14 #Georgia"
72,@patrickestarian Correct.
73,@TheBMutualist Whatever. They should have the choice lol.
74,Throwback to when Jeff Mullis drank raw milk on the floor as he introduced a bill to make it legal to be sold for consumption in GA. It is so interesting to me that it was ever illegal to begin with. Why can the gov. tell us what we can and can't put in our body? #GA14 https://t.co/edrfJOxxGs

78,Many people do not realize that @RandPaul has been an advocate of vaccine freedom/choice LONG before it was popular. He has been advocating for kids for years. There are things he has done I don't agree w/but I am thankful for his work on protecting against mandatory vaccination. https://t.co/bVVDdNFKj3
79,@RepMTG No. Oil is why we are in this mess. We have refused FOR YEARS b/c of big oil to invest in SUSTAINABLE energy. NOW is the time to start investing in it so that we have a future AND we don't end up in a situation like this again.
80,@RepMTG Did you just make it up that it was a hate crime? Or?
81,"Just a reminder that shops all across NWGA still aren't able to have their completely legal delta 8 products out on the shelf.

87,"And this friends, this is the difference between @RepMTG and myself. I wouldn't take my children to drag shows, but I most CERTAINLY wouldn't be trying to push a law to take away a parents right to decide that for their family. THIS IS MORE GOV. INVOLVEMENT! WE NEED LESS! #GA14 https://t.co/DObzQsXDIY"
88,"@RepMTG THIS FOLKS, is the different between Marjorie and myself. I won't take kids to drag shows. Not going to push a law for it b/c THE GOV SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED. Marjorie disagrees w/something wants the gov. to make sure you can't do it."
89,"@RepMTG BECAUSE BIG GOVERNMENT!!!! Taking kids to drag performances is not something I would do. BUT.. What makes you think it is the right of the gov. to tell parents how to parent?? I thought you were big on parental rights, especially against CRT being pushed on them in school?"
90,@RyanLawrence_2 @hettil @LPNational @ComicDaveSmith I wasn't sure. Thank you!
91,"@BravesLovers55 Honestly, I have been thinking about what a hold on taxes would do for the citizens right now with the horrible economic downturn we are having. Imagine what they could do with the extra money and no fear of having to pay it all back in lump sums."

97,"@GVoter2020 @weems @JOnAthAn4RealZ @LPGeorgia It wasn't all of LPGeorgia. There are some wonderful people within LPGeorgia. It was pushed by our VC, Zach and several others followed suit."
98,"I think that it is great that Marjorie has taken such an interest in the treatment of folks in the DC jail. I believe in due process. However, since she is talking about mistreatment and injustice there, she needs to come here and see the mistreatment &amp; injustice in #GA14 jails."
