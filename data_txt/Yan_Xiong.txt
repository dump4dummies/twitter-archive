1,"Great time of dancing and meeting residents after a day of celebrating love + equality for all! Beautiful end to this great day at Egg Rolls, Egg Creams, and Empanadas Street Festival on Eldridge St! https://t.co/fkLzE6Z6lE"
2,"We must also remember today that elected officials need to take LGBTQ+ Healthcare more seriously. There is already discrepancies in access to LGBTQ friendly doctors, let alone affordable health care. So yes- We need to do more for our communities!!"
3,Today is #Pride2022 in NYC! Let’s  celebrate love + equality today NYC!
4,All women always deserve the right to choose. Period. This should have been codified into the law but corporate Democrats did not do this. This is overstepping. Keep personal beliefs  out of political decisions that effect millions.
5,I applaud the @UFT for providing NYC the opportunity to DEMAND #SmallerClassSizes. This is essential to make up for learning loss. You can sign their petition here! https://t.co/plERldQEpL
6,"While our government agencies struggle to meet the moment, local business owners are left behind. Our small businesses need help NOW. We have lost too many..local business fuels our local vibrance, culture &amp; economy! https://t.co/BZfxr8h91V"
7,"Our SBA Agency needs change. The #SmallBusinessMajority, a national network of small businesses and community organizations, released a survey last month showing that about 1/3 of 201 small business owners polled who applied for an EID loan said they were ignored &amp; left w/ no aid"
8,"As we prepare to celebrate #NYCPride2022,let all leaders focus on the most vulnerable and most marginalized in the community: LGBTQ+ members facing housing insecurity or homelessness, those facing lack of health care access to LGBTQ+ doctors, and those victim to unaccepting homes"
9,"This is system is plagued with fallacies. If elected, I will work with local leaders, housing charities, LGBTQ+ health experts and the foster children themselves to create MORE  safe housing and access to LGBTQ+ friendly doctors &amp; medical professionals, and support systems."
10,"Our city is not doing enough for the vulnerable. LGBTQ+ youth in the NYC foster care system are faced with fear, rejection, and home insecurity. Too often, many end up homeless after never being adopted."
