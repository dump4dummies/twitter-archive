27,"@johnahabib @theforester000 @Shut_downAmazon If you’re talking about me - nothing you have said is reasonable. You made undue assumptions about me and advocated for something I don’t support.

32,"@johnahabib @fgarlands @Shut_downAmazon That’s purely speculation, and doesn’t change the underlying problem that I’ve stated several times now; but you still haven’t acknowledged. We need solidarity, not celebrity. These are the same traps set for union leaders of the last 60 years."
33,"@SteveLe34379022 @TheRangerRik @GovWhitmer 🤦‍♂️ I hope you realize, from your own set of facts, as-to why Line 5 does nothing for our gas prices. If not, you’re a lost cause. Good luck with this."

36,"@SteveLe34379022 @TheRangerRik @GovWhitmer Not applicable to the United States because we are a net exporter. More pipelines only increases our exportation. Again, not our oil and it’s not for us. It will not affect our gas prices, and Michigan takes a massive risk of economic devastation if there is an oil spill."

38,"@Bermuda3511 @GovWhitmer Repealing the 1931 law that criminalizes abortion would do something. Also, don’t be such a cynic about our home. Michigan is great and is always getting better."
39,"@BidensStairCase @GovWhitmer Yes. It would have been immediately criminalized here in Michigan. Fortunately, the Court in Michigan has temporarily dismissed its enforcement. I say temporarily bc the decision is on really shaky ground and if @MIAttyGen isn’t re-elected the GOP Atty Gen could appeal."
40,@NyTulsi @Shut_downAmazon He serves our country better as an organizer.
41,"@Shut_downAmazon If you’re referring to me, I would recommend you read all of what I was saying. I want solidarity not celebrity. If you’re being 💯 in that - great. Be humble and don’t forget why unions of the past failed for the same traps they are setting for you right now."
42,"@SteveLe34379022 @TheRangerRik @GovWhitmer Do you? Line 5 is Canadian Oil going from Canada to Canada. It’s not our oil, and it’s not for our use. We take on all the risk, and it alone does not change the price of gas. Not even Enbridge is making that claim."

45,"@TheIconoclast15 @ScottyBubbaYesh @Shut_downAmazon @Zendaya @amazonlabor Let me get this straight - you’re analysis of Portugal is why you think unionization declined in the United States?

48,"@TheIconoclast15 @ScottyBubbaYesh @Shut_downAmazon @Zendaya @amazonlabor That’s genuinely not true kid, but good luck with that. You’re actively setting up the next generation of union organizers to fail in the future for the exact same reasons it failed in the past. Only this time it didn’t take 60 years. You did almost immediately."
49,@TheIconoclast15 @ScottyBubbaYesh @Shut_downAmazon @Zendaya @amazonlabor Um… no? That’s how unions became corrupted last time. Union leaders chose status over their obligations.
