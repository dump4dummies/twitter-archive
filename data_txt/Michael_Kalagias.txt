1,@NWADoug For over a century the Dems have had a free hand in gerrymandering the districts in Arkansas. Not surprising the Republicans would respond this way given their first opportunity to gerrymander them since reconstruction.
2,@TomCottonAR It's been a gross invasion of privacy and violation of the 4th Amendment since it was signed into law in 1970. How about you introduce a repeal to the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and fix it right.

Love child?"
62,@TomCottonAR True. But that's not remotely a government issue. There hasn't been a budget much less a balanced one since you took office. The national debt has nearly doubled in that same time. Worry about doing YOUR job before looking for flaws in someone else's.
63,"@rep_stevewomack You've been in Congress for a decade. You're on the budget committee, even chaired it for a while. But you never once proposed a balanced budget. Or passed any budget at all. You have voted for every debt limit increase though, and all those CR's you claim to hate. Do YOUR Job."
64,"@rep_stevewomack So when are we going to do the same to Saudi Arabia? Not only are they a state sponsor of terror, but (unlike Iran) they've killed thousands of Americans on US soil with their terrorist attacks."
65,"@rep_stevewomack You've keep saying that, but have yet to attempt doing anything about it. Including during your time as chair of the budget committee.
Actions speak louder than words. You've voted for every debt limit increase and bloated spending bill since you took office."
66,"@TomCottonAR But then, you have already shown absolutely zero respect for the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, or 9th Amendments so no surprise you have none for the 1st either. Is there any part of the Bill of Rights you agree with?"
67,@TomCottonAR The First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Issue 3 makes such petitioning nearly impossible. Arkansans should vote no on all 3 issues because the Constitution  is important and should be respected.

71,@NWADoug It's like the folks pulling the strings at the RNC and DNC have bets going about which one can nominate a worse candidate and still win.
72,@NWADoug Biden isn't much better than Clinton. Trump losing this election should have been a slam dunk given. The Dems decision to nominate the worst candidates they can find makes it competitive.

76,@CourtLanning @Samrobb4Liberty @Jorgensen4POTUS They're working on the same sort of thing in Idaho too. It just takes a lot to get a new design ready for commercial use. And there will always be costs to nuclear that conventional plants won't have.
77,"@Samrobb4Liberty @Jorgensen4POTUS I'm all for letting nuclear compete, but in a fair fight it won't win. The costs are too high. It's a better option than wind or solar for base load generation, but trash incinerators in existing coal plants and new hydro plants are greener and cheaper options."

79,"@NWADoug Trillion dollar plus deficits have been the average since the end of the last Bush administration. While the presidents have been complicit, it is Congress that passes the spending bills. Lots of blame to go around, Dem and GOP. Sadly voters aren't holding them accountable."

92,"@NWADoug @rep_stevewomack The best way to restrain the power of the President and Congress is through a balanced budget amendment. Unfortunately, that requires the cooperation of those you need to restrain and isn't going to happen. Until we elect different people. That means 3rd parties and independents."
93,"@NWADoug @rep_stevewomack The problem with wielding the budget as a weapon is that the way to increase your power or negotiate compromise is to increase your spending. We can't afford the spending we had 20 years ago, much less the spending we have now. Increasing it even more is a bad idea.
