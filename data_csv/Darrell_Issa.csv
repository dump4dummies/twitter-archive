643,2021-01-07 06:33:21+00:00,1347068791285538817,We are far better than what we saw last summer and today. We can now prove that we are the America my friend believed – and I believe – is better.
644,2021-01-07 06:33:02+00:00,1347068712269000705,"Now, our country must come together. Our nation can get this right. That is overdue as well. My good friend in Congress Elijah Cummings told me time and again that “America is better than this.” We lost Elijah last year, but his words are as true as ever."
645,2021-01-07 06:32:33+00:00,1347068588931379201,"As the violence in the Capitol today was indefensible, so, too, was the willful destruction of so many neighborhoods and towns last summer. And yet, widespread consensus that condemned these nationwide riots was elusive. America deserved better this summer and didn’t get it."
646,2021-01-07 06:32:04+00:00,1347068465941782529,"Serious crimes were committed and a life was tragically lost. Our nation deserves far better. This is a time to give our all, honor our institutions and uphold our American democracy. Let's speak with one voice in making that a national consensus."

650,2021-01-06 20:57:07+00:00,1346923775724544000,"To all protesting at the Capitol: It is time to disperse in a safe and orderly manner. Please support the Capitol Police, local law enforcement, and the National Guard. Help others to do the same."
651,2021-01-05 03:02:35+00:00,1346290974197051392,"I'm very saddened to learn of the passing of Sheriff Sandra Hutchens. She was an iconic law enforcement leader and personal friend. To her family and all who served with her, I want to share my heart felt sympathy and condolences."
652,2021-01-03 20:55:34+00:00,1345836223575691264,"There is so much for the House to do this year and next, and there’s no time to waste. Let’s get to work."

654,2021-01-03 20:54:48+00:00,1345836027408052224,To the residents of California’s 50th district – those I have represented before or who are new constituents – I will uphold the promises I made in gaining your support and earning your trust.
655,2021-01-03 20:53:58+00:00,1345835820377231360,I'm honored to again take the oath of office to serve as a Representative in Congress and eager to confront the challenges we face as a nation and advance solutions that will benefit our people for many years to come.

In that spirit, I will be declining this proposed preferential treatment. There are so many of our fellow citizens in need, and we must put all vulnerable Americans first."
659,2020-12-18 02:09:46+00:00,1339754698547458048,"I am pleased to hear that Judge Wohlfeil has ruled that the restaurants in San Diego County are Essential and protected from the Governor’s lockdown order.
