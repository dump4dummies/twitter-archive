711,2020-11-21 22:39:02+00:00,1330279584227581953,,@40wattbulb I personally think the most important thing is to protect women‚Äôs lives. I often used the line that Roe v. Wade isn‚Äôt the day abortions began rather it‚Äôs the day women stopped dying from them. But the fight has resulted in women being left in horrible situations.
712,2020-11-21 22:36:14+00:00,1330278878942801920,,@40wattbulb You should check out the film. I‚Äôm concerned the refusal to find a workable compromise is leading to death.

I‚Äôve always thought we should do that. I‚Äôve never understood requiring women to go find a new doctor that they‚Äôve never seen before &amp; will likely never see you again.
714,2020-11-21 20:41:37+00:00,1330250032034029569,,@40wattbulb So you are ok w/ laws being different state to state? Some states don‚Äôt allow medically necessary abortions after the first trimester. You should watch ‚ÄúBirthright‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt. Women are dying having abortions they need bcuz states won‚Äôt differentiate between need &amp; elective.
