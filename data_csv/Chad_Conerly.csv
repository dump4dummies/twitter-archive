A very extended campgn would be the only option for an “R” to challenge an R incumbent, because they’d be running against the entire LA GOP machine.  A run against Kennedy would be in vain IMO. https://t.co/yZDs6XQaRw"

This week, I spoke to LP / northeast La voters about the need for genuine “outsider” leadership in DC. We must return power to the people, not special interest.  Look forward to more visits. #lalege #lagov #LA05"
