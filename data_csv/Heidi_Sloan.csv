577,2019-12-15 20:39:39+00:00,1206312888169881603,Louis says labor leaders feel it's their responsibility to get healthcare for workers. The cost has been rising faster than wages. Workers give up $5-10 an hour to pay for insurance.

585,2019-12-15 20:28:27+00:00,1206310069723377666,"It didn't cost too much to bail out Wall Street. We can afford to make universal healthcare happen. We used to believe we could do big things in this country, and we need to bring that back."
586,2019-12-15 20:27:15+00:00,1206309768249454596,Nobody in Canada is talking about getting rid of their public healthcare. It would be political suicide. Everyone from socialists to conservatives there loves it.
587,2019-12-15 20:26:11+00:00,1206309498639527939,"Louis talks about the ways money is being shifted into the pockets of the 1%. The working class is in the hole! So people like @AndrewYang acknowledges that the economy is unfair, but instead of cutting everyone a check, let's demand universal healthcare."
588,2019-12-15 20:24:22+00:00,1206309042685202435,"Free college was a pipe dream, and now it's a popular demand. We are the ones who are going to make change possible."
589,2019-12-15 20:23:37+00:00,1206308853123633152,"Sofia says all fights relate to health justice. Incarcerated people are often experiencing health issues that go untreated. We must generate the kind of wind it takes to move electeds, and that means doing intersectional work."
590,2019-12-15 20:22:00+00:00,1206308446708158475,"Jack's next question - our Congressional campaign's slogan is #OneFightAllIn. Our fight is taking power away from the ultra rich &amp; corporations, and giving it to working people. How is M4A a part of that?"
591,2019-12-15 20:20:38+00:00,1206308104855572483,Sofia points out that immigrant rights orgs also fought to include people regardless of legal status. Tim says Sanders was pushed to include long-term care by Jayapal's bill. Amazing.
592,2019-12-15 20:19:33+00:00,1206307832133488640,It's gonna take a movement in the streets to win this fight. We're here to build enduring power.
593,2019-12-15 20:18:56+00:00,1206307673647529985,"When we bring repro justice, disability rights, and labor to the table, our movement gets stronger. When @RepJayapal wrote the bill, @NationalADAPT pushed her to include community-based care for people with disabilities."
594,2019-12-15 20:17:36+00:00,1206307339269287936,"When we organize, I want people to back this campaign sure, but more than anything I want to move people go connect with their own power. Unions are the best example of orgs that do this work."
595,2019-12-15 20:16:28+00:00,1206307055314841602,"I agree with everything - but also, I'm running for Congress. I've worked with my friends to move congressmen who we know can be moved by the wind of popular opinion. I'm not running to be moved, I'm moving to generate a storm."
596,2019-12-15 20:15:11+00:00,1206306733200728069,"We have to see that when we organize in our communities, through massive mobilizations we will win because this proposal is popular. We have to talk where we can, with whom we can."
597,2019-12-15 20:14:15+00:00,1206306496813961224,"In San Antonio, Maine weve seen victories. @NationalADAPT has been taking on this fight with Medicaid programs for 40 years and won. Idaho saw a couple people in a van organizing and won 60% of the vote with a petition."
598,2019-12-15 20:11:57+00:00,1206305916691386368,Tim pushes back on the idea this will be complicated. Clarifies that we cannot elect our way to M4A. Our electeds will be outgunned by a reactionary rich establishment. But there's good news.
599,2019-12-15 20:10:40+00:00,1206305595051192320,The just transition is enormously important - we want to make sure we speak to workers who will be displaced.
600,2019-12-15 20:09:12+00:00,1206305224761257984,Labor is a critical ally in this fight. We have 20 unions that have signed on or publicly endorsed M4A. @NationalNurses is one leader on our side! Part of it is recognizing that unions routinely have to forego wage increases in order to maintain health coverage.
601,2019-12-15 20:07:21+00:00,1206304759663276034,"But either way, they will spend every dime they have fighting us because we're gonna put them out of business."
602,2019-12-15 20:06:41+00:00,1206304592520269824,"Louis says he's mad now! Understanding who the enemy is is very important. Pharmaceutical industries, insurance industries. What do they hate more, M4A or the public option? Right now, they're targeting the public option because they want to make M4A seem too left, unattainable."
603,2019-12-15 20:05:03+00:00,1206304181079986176,"She talks about countering misinformation, and the importance of arming our people with the truth. Don't waste time on the opposition, there are thousands in your community who can be mobilized through anger!"
604,2019-12-15 20:03:50+00:00,1206303873985630209,"We have to target people strategically. We focus on Democrats because we know we can move them more quickly. We're gonna block walk, bring our communities together. We started with 10 people, now we have over 70. That's the power of organizing."
605,2019-12-15 20:02:29+00:00,1206303535111032835,"Sofia says to ORGANIZE. When she started doing this work, we targeted @LloydDoggettTX with marches, leaving signs with stories at his door, working with people (including me!) to win."
606,2019-12-15 20:00:56+00:00,1206303143933427714,Next question - M4A represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in this country's history. What's it gonna take to win?
607,2019-12-15 19:59:57+00:00,1206302896670871552,When we are all part of the same collective bargaining unit - the largest one in the country - I don't think we're gonna stop negotiating. That's why I'm ready for M4A.
608,2019-12-15 19:59:03+00:00,1206302672392982528,I am ready for my mom and @GovAbbott to be in the same boat so he will stop trying to sink it.
609,2019-12-15 19:58:33+00:00,1206302544269586432,Life span is directly tied to income I have watched my neighbors and my own mother be misdiagnosed.
610,2019-12-15 19:57:48+00:00,1206302354817110019,"M4A is a movement that ties us to our neighbors. In my work at a housing community for the chronically homeless, I have seen that when we are denied care, we are seen as less human."
611,2019-12-15 19:56:56+00:00,1206302138252615682,"I am proud to stand with the folks on this stage, who I met doing this work. Between a public option and M4A, who do the profiteers oppose more? Do you think your health insurance industry has your best interest at heart?"
612,2019-12-15 19:55:34+00:00,1206301795657621505,"Health justice is the goal, and single payer is the tool to get there. We see intersections with race, environment, gender identity. M4A doesn't solve these problems on its own, but allows us to organize to fight the monsters behind the injustice we face."
613,2019-12-15 19:54:01+00:00,1206301405167923201,"With single payer, we realize health equity, health justice. When housing makes people sick, that will become a public policy concern. Same with food. Same with mental health care and addiction treatment."
614,2019-12-15 19:52:40+00:00,1206301064418529284,"Only a single payer system can use the power of insuring everyone, rich and poor, sick and healthy, to make healthcare universal. The public option concedes power to these healthcare profiteers."
615,2019-12-15 19:51:45+00:00,1206300835162001409,Tim - it's not profitable to insure people who are sick. It's extremely profitable to charge sick people as much as you can. Premiums and deductibles skyrocket and the profit motive is at the root of that trend.
616,2019-12-15 19:50:13+00:00,1206300448250040323,Again @BernieSanders is mentioned - we do not believe that M4A will happen overnight. We will have a transition.
617,2019-12-15 19:49:11+00:00,1206300188744323082,There is a contradiction between the profit motive and the administrative costs and the desire to keep healthcare affordable. And the government already pays for the elderly through the existing Medicare system!
618,2019-12-15 19:47:33+00:00,1206299778272890885,"Both countries also do a better job controlling cost. Louis talks about debating a libertarian on this point - when you have a single buyer, you have enormous leverage to demand info on costs. They gotta work with us if we're the only payer."
619,2019-12-15 19:46:07+00:00,1206299417457889283,Louis points out we don't have to reimagine the world. Canada &amp; Taiwan both have state-run healthcare systems. Both countries cover more than the US and achieve better outcomes.

622,2019-12-15 19:41:52+00:00,1206298345838391296,Why do we demand a single payer #M4A system? Not a public option? What's so important about these demands?
