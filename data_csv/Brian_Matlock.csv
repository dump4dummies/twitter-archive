They failed to acknowledge that they would get at least some of that money, as well as the top 23 highest paid execs got $450k in raises last year."
16,2021-06-25 22:25:22+00:00,1408551921225453571,"BPU will get money from those approved, but due to the program not being functional, they didn't want to assume financial risk by foregoing shutoffs until there was a final KERA determination. The people have been fighting for a moratorium until KERA gets money to our community."

Only 287 had been approved. $$ is not going to the people who need it."
18,2021-06-25 22:25:21+00:00,1408551918973210629,Big win for the community as @KCKBPU has approved a one-month moratorium on utility shutoffs. This has been the result of incredible efforts and organizing from community members for themselves and one another. Also shoutout to @BuildPowerMoKan and @CEPheartland for your work.
19,2021-06-07 18:05:29+00:00,1401963538810380290,"An aside:my one issue was with their repeated use of the ""taxpayer money"" and zero sum budgeting tropes. That will hurt the cause in the long run and runs counter to their assertion that those who can't work thus don't pay taxes are worthy of public money and decisionmaking."
