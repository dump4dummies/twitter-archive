1,2019-06-02 18:10:27+00:00,1135247320390471685,I've looked at each serious candidate for President and the only candidate I see that truly is compassionate and is trustworthy is Bernie Sanders.  Sorry but I won't vote for a candidate whom I cannot trust for any office.  This is also why I must primary Cheri Bustos in #IL17.

Many of these fail our children and when money is the top reason you've opened a school you've already lost the point.  Our children are the top reason and giving them anything less than a quality education shouldn't stand.
