811,2018-10-17 09:22:30+00:00,1052490023679881217,,@axcomrade @MayorSchieve @EddieLorton I've never seen a Mayor's race not have one. That's extremely rare. It doesnt matter because people wanted one this year. Previous elections dont matter. You didn't do much else otherwise except complain about made up groups.
812,2018-10-17 09:16:29+00:00,1052488507002736641,,@axcomrade @MayorSchieve @EddieLorton Lol it does in every election except maybe dog catcher or whatever. That's incorrect now you're intentionally being dishonest. Read my original tweet since you have a memory problem.

&gt;""wanting two candidates to debate which happens in literally every other election happened because you were fooled to believe that, no one should be debating""

Okay buddy"
814,2018-10-17 09:02:36+00:00,1052485014431006721,,@axcomrade @MayorSchieve @EddieLorton And you're also extremely foolish and fairly naive to assume that the peoples outrage is due to some group no ones heard of. Not having debates in the past is irrelevant. People having been calling for a debate in this election for months on end.

I care about the candidates having a debate. I care about them actually making an effort. I care about them making time to present their cases to the people. I dont care about the reno elections group
